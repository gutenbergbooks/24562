<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE"></a>EDITOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>In his opening chapter Sir James Douie refers to the fact that the area
treated in this volume&mdash;just one quarter of a million square miles&mdash;is
comparable to that of Austria-Hungary. The comparison might be extended;
for on ethnographical, linguistic and physical grounds, the geographical
unit now treated is just as homogeneous in composition as the Dual
Monarchy. It is only in the political sense and by force of the ruling
classes, temporarily united in one monarch, that the term
<i>Osterreichisch</i> could be used to include the Poles of Galicia, the
Czechs of Bohemia and Moravia, the Szeklers, Saxons and more numerous
Rumanians of Transylvania, the Croats, Slovenes and Italians of
"Illyria," with the Magyars of the Hungarian plain.</p>

<p>The term <i>Punj&aacute;bi</i> much more nearly, but still imperfectly, covers the
people of the Panj&aacute;b, the North-West Frontier Province, Kashm&iacute;r and the
associated smaller Native States. The Sikh, Muhammadan and Hindu Jats,
the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;s and the R&aacute;jputs all belong to the tall, fair, leptorrhine
Indo-Aryan main stock of the area, merging on the west and south-west
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>into the Biluch and Path&aacute;n Turko-Iranian, and fringed in the hill
districts on the north with what have been described as products of the
"contact metamorphism" with the Mongoloid tribes of Central Asia. Thus,
in spite of the inevitable blurring of boundary lines, the political
divisions treated together in this volume, form a fairly clean-cut
geographical unit.</p>

<p>Sir James Douie, in this work, is obviously living over again the happy
thirty-five years which he devoted to the service of North-West India:
his accounts of the physiography, the flora and fauna, the people and
the administration are essentially the personal recollections of one who
has first studied the details as a District Officer and has afterwards
corrected his perspective, stage by stage, from the successively higher
view-point of a Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, Financial
Commissioner, and finally as Officiating Lieut.-Governor. No one could
more appropriately undertake the task of an accurate and
well-proportioned thumb-nail sketch of North-West India and, what is
equally important to the earnest reader, no author could more obviously
delight in his subject.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE_BY_AUTHOR" id="NOTE_BY_AUTHOR"></a>NOTE BY AUTHOR</h2>


<p>My thanks are due to the Government of India for permission to use
illustrations contained in official publications. Except where otherwise
stated the numerous maps included in the volume are derived from this
source. My obligations to provincial and district gazetteers have been
endless. Sir Thomas Holdich kindly allowed me to reproduce some of the
charts in his excellent book on <i>India</i>. The accuracy of the sections on
geology and coins may be relied on, as they were written by masters of
these subjects, Sir Thomas Holland and Mr R. B. Whitehead, I.C.S.
Chapter XVII could not have been written at all without the help
afforded by Mr Vincent Smith's <i>Early History of India</i>. I have
acknowledged my debts to other friends in the "List of Illustrations."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Introductory.</b>&mdash;Of the provinces of India the Panj&aacute;b must always have a
peculiar interest for Englishmen. Invasions by land from the west have
perforce been launched across its great plains. The English were the
first invaders who, possessing sea power, were able to outflank the
mountain ranges which guard the north and west of India. Hence the
Panj&aacute;b was the last, and not the first, of their Indian conquests, and
the courage and efficiency of the Sikh soldiery, even after the guiding
hand of the old Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Ranj&iacute;t Singh was withdrawn, made it also one of
the hardest. The success of the early administration of the province,
which a few years after annexation made it possible to use its resources
in fighting men to help in the task of putting down the mutiny, has
always been a matter of just pride, while the less familiar story of the
conquests of peace in the first sixty years of British rule may well
arouse similar feelings.</p>




<p><b>Scope of work.</b>&mdash;A geography of the Panj&aacute;b will fitly embrace an account
also of the North-West Frontier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Province, which in 1901 was severed
from it and formed into a separate administration, of the small area
recently placed directly under the government of India on the transfer
of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, and of the native states in
political dependence on the Panj&aacute;b Government. It will also be
convenient to include Kashm&iacute;r and the tribal territory beyond the
frontier of British India which is politically controlled from Pesh&aacute;war.
The whole tract covers ten degrees of latitude and eleven of longitude.
The furthest point of the Kashm&iacute;r frontier is in 37&deg; 2' N., which is
much the same as the latitude of Syracuse. In the south-east the Panj&aacute;b
ends at 27&deg; 4' N., corresponding roughly to the position of the
southernmost of the Canary Islands. Lines drawn west from Pesh&aacute;war and
Lahore would pass to the north of Beirut and Jerusalem respectively.
Mult&aacute;n and Cairo are in the same latitude, and so are Delhi and
Teneriffe. Kashm&iacute;r stretches eastwards to longitude 80&deg; 3' and the
westernmost part of Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n is in 69&deg; 2' E.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Area.</b>&mdash;The area dealt with is roughly 253,000 square
miles. This is but two-thirteenths of the area of the Indian Empire, and
yet it is less by only 10,000 square miles than that of Austria-Hungary
including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area consists of:</p>

<p>On the north the highlands include the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan
(Siw&aacute;lik) tracts to the south and east of the Indus, and north of that
river the Muztagh-Karakoram range and the bleak salt plateau beyond that
range reaching almost up to the Kuenlun mountains. To the west of the
Indus they include those spurs of the Hindu Kush which run into Chitr&aacute;l
and Dir, the Buner and Sw&aacute;t hills, the Safed Koh, the Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n hills,
the Sulim&aacute;n range, and the low hills in the trans-Indus districts of the
North West Frontier Province.</p>

<p><b>Boundary with China.</b>&mdash;There is a point to the north of Hunza in Kashm&iacute;r
where three great mountain chains, the Muztagh from the south-east, the
Hindu Kush from the south-west, and the Sarikol (an offshoot of the
Kuenlun) from the north-east, meet. It is also the meeting-place of the
Indian, Chinese, and Russian empires and of Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n. Westwards from
this the boundary of Kashm&iacute;r and Chinese Turkest&aacute;n runs for 350 miles
(omitting curves) through a desolate upland lying well to the north of
the Muztagh-Karakoram range. Finally in the north-east corner of Kashm&iacute;r
the frontier impinges on the great Central Asian axis of the Kuenlun.
From this point it turns southwards and separates Chinese Tibet from the
salt Lingzi Thang plains and the Indus valley in Kashm&iacute;r, and the
eastern part of the native state of Bashahr, which physically form a
portion of Tibet.</p>

<p><b>Boundary with United Provinces.</b>&mdash;The south-east corner of Bashahr is a
little to the north of the great Ked&aacute;rn&aacute;th peak in the Central Him&aacute;laya
and of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> source of the Jamna. Here the frontier strikes to the west
dividing Bashahr from Teri Garhw&aacute;l, a native state under the control of
the government of the United Provinces. Turning again to the south it
runs to the junction of the Tons and Jamna, separating Teri Garhw&aacute;l from
Sirm&uacute;r and some of the smaller Simla Hill States. Henceforth the Jamna
is with small exceptions the boundary between the Panj&aacute;b and the United
Provinces.</p>

<p><b>Boundary with Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n.</b>&mdash;We must now return to our starting-point at
the eastern extremity of the Hindu Kush, and trace the boundary with
Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n. The frontier runs west and south-west along the Hindu Kush
to the Dorah pass dividing Chitr&aacute;l from the Afgh&aacute;n province of Wakhan,
and streams which drain into the Indus from the head waters of the Oxus.
At the Dorah pass it turns sharply to the south, following a great spur
which parts the valley of the Chitr&aacute;l river (British) from that of its
Afgh&aacute;n affluent, the Bashgol. Below the junction of the two streams at
Arnawai the Chitr&aacute;l changes its name and becomes the Kunar. Near this
point the "Durand" line begins. In 1893 an agreement was made between
the Amir Abdurrahman and Sir Mortimer Durand as representative of the
British Government determining the frontier line from Chandak in the
valley of the Kunar, twelve miles north of Asmar, to the Persian border.
Asmar is an Afgh&aacute;n village on the left bank of the Kunar to the south of
Arnawai. In 1894 the line was demarcated along the eastern watershed of
the Kunar valley to Nawakotal on the confines of Bajaur and the country
of the Mohmands.</p>

<p>Thence the frontier, which has not been demarcated, passes through the
heart of the Mohmand country to the K&aacute;bul river and beyond it to our
frontier post in the Khaibar at Landikh&aacute;na.</p>

<p>From this point the line, still undemarcated, runs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> on in a
south-westerly direction to the Safed Koh, and then strikes west along
it to the Sikar&aacute;m mountain near the Paiwar Kotal at the head of the
Kurram valley. From Sikar&aacute;m the frontier runs south and south-east
crossing the upper waters of the Kurram, and dividing our possessions
from the Afgh&aacute;n province of Khost. This line was demarcated in 1894.</p>

<p>At the south of the Kurram valley the frontier sweeps round to the west
leaving in the British sphere the valley of the Toch&iacute;. Turning again to
the south it crosses the upper waters of the Toch&iacute; and passes round the
back of Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n by the Shawal valley and the plains about W&aacute;na to
Domand&iacute; on the Gomal river, where Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, Biluchist&aacute;n, and the
North West Frontier Province meet. The Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n boundary was
demarcated in 1895.</p>

<p><b>Political and Administrative Boundaries.</b>&mdash;The boundary described above
defines spheres of influence, and only in the Kurram valley does it
coincide with that of the districts for whose orderly administration we
hold ourselves responsible. All we ask of Waz&iacute;rs, Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s, or Mohmands
is to leave our people at peace; we have no concern with their quarrels
or blood feuds, so long as they abide in their mountains or only leave
them for the sake of lawful gain. Our administrative boundary, which
speaking broadly we took over from the Sikhs, usually runs at the foot
of the hills. A glance at the map will show that between Pesh&aacute;war and
Koh&aacute;t the territory of the independent tribes comes down almost to the
Indus. At this point the hills occupied by the Jow&aacute;k&iacute; section of the
Afr&iacute;d&iacute; tribe push out a great tongue eastwards. Our military frontier
road runs through these hills, and we actually pay the tribesmen of the
Koh&aacute;t pass for our right of way. Another tongue of tribal territory
reaches right down to the Indus, and almost severs the Pesh&aacute;war and
Haz&aacute;ra districts. Further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> north the frontier of Haz&aacute;ra lies well to the
east of the Indus.</p>

<p><b>Frontier with Biluchist&aacute;n.</b>&mdash;At Domand&iacute; the frontier turns to the east,
and following the Gomal river to its junction with the Zhob at Kaj&uacute;r&iacute;
Kach forms the boundary of the two British administrations. Henceforth
the general direction of the line is determined by the trend of the
Sulim&aacute;n range. It runs south to the Vehoa pass, where the country of the
Path&aacute;ns of the North West Frontier Province ends and that of the Hill
and Plain Biluches subject to the Panj&aacute;b Government begins. From the
Vehoa pass to the Kah&aacute; torrent the line is drawn so as to leave Biluch
tribes with the Panj&aacute;b and Path&aacute;n tribes with the Biluchist&aacute;n Agency.
South of the Kah&aacute; the division is between Biluch tribes, the Marr&iacute;s and
Bugt&iacute;s to the west being managed from Quetta, and the Gurch&aacute;n&iacute;s and
Maz&aacute;r&iacute;s, who are largely settled in the plains, being included in Dera
Gh&aacute;zi Kh&aacute;n, the trans-Indus district of the Panj&aacute;b. At the south-west
corner of the Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n district the Panj&aacute;b, Sind, and Biluchist&aacute;n
meet. From this point the short common boundary of the Panj&aacute;b and Sind
runs east to the Indus.</p>

<p><b>The Southern Boundary.</b>&mdash;East of the Indus the frontier runs south-east
for about fifty miles parting Sind from the Bah&aacute;walpur State, till a
point is reached where Sind, R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, and Bah&aacute;walpur join. A little
further to the east is the southern extremity of Bah&aacute;walpur at 70&deg; 8' E.
and 27&deg; 5' N. From this point a line drawn due east would at a distance
of 370 miles pass a few miles to the north of the south end of Gurgaon
and a few miles to the south of the border of the Narnaul tract of
Pati&aacute;la. Between Narnaul and the south-east corner of the Bah&aacute;walpur
State the great R&aacute;jput&aacute;na desert, mainly occupied in this quarter by
Bikaner, thrusts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> northwards a huge wedge reaching almost up to the
Sutlej. To the west of the wedge is Bah&aacute;walpur and to the east the
British district of Hiss&aacute;r. The apex is less than 100 miles from Lahore,
while a line drawn due south from that city to latitude 27'5&deg; north
would exceed 270 miles in length. The Jaipur State lies to the south and
west of Narnaul, while Gurgaon has across its southern frontiers Alwar
and Bharatpur, and near the Jamna the Muttra district of the United
Provinces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<h3>MOUNTAINS, HILLS, AND PLAINS</h3>


<p><b>The Great Northern Rampart.</b>&mdash;The huge mountain rampart which guards the
northern frontier of India thrusts out in the north-west a great bastion
whose outer walls are the Hindu Kush and the Muztagh-Karakoram ranges.
Behind the latter with a general trend from south-east to north-west are
the great valley of the Indus to the point near Gilgit where it turns
sharply to the south, and a succession of mountain chains and glens
making up the Himalayan tract, through which the five rivers of the
Panj&aacute;b and the Jamna find their way to the plains. To meet trans-Indus
extensions of the Him&aacute;laya the Hindu Kush pushes out from its main axis
great spurs to the south, flanking the valleys which drain into the
Indus either directly or through the K&aacute;bul river.</p>

<p><b>The Him&aacute;laya.</b>&mdash;Tibet, which from the point of view of physical geography
includes a large and little known area in the Kashm&iacute;r State to the north
of the Karakoram range, is a lofty, desolate, wind swept plateau with a
mean elevation of about 15,000 feet. In the part of it situated to the
north of the north-west corner of Nip&aacute;l lies the Manasarowar lake, in
the neighbourhood of which three great Indian rivers, the Tsanpo or
Brahmap&uacute;tra, the Sutlej, and the Indus, take their rise. The Indus flows
to the north-west for 500 miles and then turns abruptly to the south to
seek its distant home in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> Indian Ocean. The Tsanpo has a still
longer course of 800 miles eastwards before it too bends southwards to
flow through Assam into the Bay of Bengal. Between the points where
these two giant rivers change their direction there extends for a
distance of 1500 miles the vast congeries of mountain ranges known
collectively as the "Him&aacute;laya" or "Abode of Snow." As a matter of
convenience the name is sometimes confined to the mountains east of the
Indus, but geologically the hills of Buner and Sw&aacute;t to the north of
Pesh&aacute;war probably belong to the same system. In Sanskrit literature the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Himalaya is also known as "Himavata," whence the classical Emodus.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Kum&aacute;on Him&aacute;laya.</b>&mdash;The Him&aacute;laya may be divided longitudinally into
three sections, the eastern or Sikkim, the mid or Kum&aacute;on, and the
north-western or Lad&aacute;kh. With the first we are not concerned. The Kum&aacute;on
section lies mainly in the United Provinces, but it includes the sources
of the Jamna, and contains the chain in the Panj&aacute;b which is at once the
southern watershed of the Sutlej and the great divide between the two
river systems of Northern India, the Gangetic draining into the Bay of
Bengal, and the Indus carrying the enormous discharge of the north-west
Him&aacute;laya, the Muztagh-Karakoram, and the Hindu Kush ranges into the
Indian Ocean. Simla stands on the south-western end of this watershed,
and below it the Him&aacute;laya drops rapidly to the Siw&aacute;lik foot-hills and to
the plains. Jakko, the <i>deod&aacute;r</i>-clad hill round which so much of the
life of the summer capital of India revolves, attains a height of 8000
feet. The highest peak within a radius of 25 miles of Simla is the Chor,
which is over 12,000 feet high, and does not lose its snow cap till May.
Hattu, the well-known hill above Narkanda, which is 40 miles from Simla
by road, is 1000 feet lower. But further west in Bashahr the higher
peaks range from 16,000 to 22,000 feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Inner Him&aacute;laya or Z&aacute;nskar Range.</b>&mdash;The division of the Him&aacute;laya into
the three sections named above is convenient for descriptive purposes.
But its chief axis runs through all the sections. East of Nip&aacute;l it
strikes into Tibet not very far from the source of the Tsanpo, is soon
pierced by the gorge of the Sutlej, and beyond it forms the southern
watershed of the huge Indus valley. In the west this great rampart is
known as the Z&aacute;nskar range. For a short distance it is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> boundary
between the Panj&aacute;b and Kashm&iacute;r, separating two outlying portions of the
K&aacute;ngra district, Lahul and Spit&iacute;, from Lad&aacute;kh. In this section the peaks
are from 19,000 to 21,000 feet high, and the Baral&aacute;cha pass on the road
from the Kulu valley in K&aacute;ngra to Leh, the capital of Lad&aacute;kh, is at an
elevation of about 16,500 feet. In Kashm&iacute;r the Z&aacute;nskar or Inner Him&aacute;laya
divides the valley of the Indus from those of the Chen&aacute;b and Jhelam. It
has no mountain to dispute supremacy with Everest (29,000 feet), or
Kinchinjunga in the Eastern Him&aacute;laya, but the inferiority is only
relative. The twin peaks called Nun and Kun to the east of Sr&iacute;nagar
exceed 23,000 feet, and in the extreme north-west the grand mountain
mass of Nanga Parvat towers above the Indus to a height of 26,182 feet.
The lowest point in the chain is the Zojil&aacute; (11,300 feet) on the route
from Sr&iacute;nagar, the capital of Kashm&iacute;r, to Leh on the Indus</p>

<p>The road from Sr&iacute;nagar to Gilgit passes over the Burzil pass at an
elevation of 13,500 feet.</p>

<p>The Zojil&aacute; is at the top of the beautiful valley of the Sind river, a
tributary of the Jhelam. The lofty Z&aacute;nskar range blocks the inward flow
of the monsoon, and once the Zojil&aacute; is crossed the aspect of the country
entirely changes. The land of forest glades and green pastures is left
behind, and a region of naked and desolate grandeur begins.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The waste of snow ... is the frontier of barren Tibet, where sandy
wastes replace verdant meadows, and where the wild ridges, jutting
up against the sky, are kept bare of vegetation, their strata
crumbling under the destructive action of frost and water, leaving
bare ribs of gaunt and often fantastic outline.... The colouring of
the mountains is remarkable throughout Lad&aacute;kh and nowhere more so
than near the Fotul&aacute; (a pass on the road to Leh to the south of the
Indus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> gorge).... As we ascend the peaks suggest organ pipes, so
vertical are the ridges, so jagged the ascending outlines. And each
pipe is painted a different colour ... pale slate green, purple,
yellow, grey, orange, and chocolate, each colour corresponding with
a layer of the slate, shale, limestone, or trap strata" (Neve's
<i>Picturesque Kashmir</i>, pp. 108 and 117).</p></div>

<span class="caption">Fig. 4. Burzil Pass.</span>
</div>

<p>In all this desolation there are tiny oases where level soil and a
supply of river water permit of cultivation and of some tree growth.</p>

<p><b>Water divide near Baral&aacute;cha and Rotang Passes in Kulu.</b>&mdash;We have seen
that the Indus and its greatest tributary, the Sutlej, rise beyond the
Him&aacute;laya in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> Tibetan plateau. The next great water divide is in the
neighbourhood of the Baral&aacute;cha pass and the Rotang pass, 30 miles to the
south of it. The route from Simla to Leh runs at a general level of 7000
to 9000 feet along or near the Sutlej-Jamna watershed to Narkanda (8800
feet). Here it leaves the Hindust&aacute;n-Tibet road and drops rapidly into
the Sutlej gorge, where the Lur&iacute; bridge is only 2650 feet above sea
level. Rising steeply on the other side the Jalaur&iacute; pass on the
watershed between the Sutlej and the Bi&aacute;s is crossed at an elevation of
10,800 feet. A more gradual descent brings the traveller to the Bi&aacute;s at
L&aacute;rj&iacute;, 3080 feet above sea level. The route then follows the course of
the Bi&aacute;s through the beautiful Kulu valley to the Rotang pass (13,326
feet), near which the river rises. The upper part of the valley is
flanked on the west by the short, but very lofty Bara Bang&aacute;hal range,
dividing Kulu from K&aacute;ngra and the source of the Bi&aacute;s from that of the
R&aacute;v&iacute;. Beyond the Rotang is Lahul, which is divided by a watershed from
Spit&iacute; and the torrents which drain into the Sutlej. On the western side
of this watershed are the sources of the Chandra and Bh&aacute;ga, which unite
to form the river known in the plains as the Chen&aacute;b.</p>

<p><b>Mid Him&aacute;laya or Pang&iacute; Range.</b>&mdash;The Mid Him&aacute;layan or Pang&iacute; range, striking
west from the Rotang pass and the northern end of the Bara Bang&aacute;hal
chain, passes through the heart of Chamba dividing the valley of the
Chen&aacute;b (Pang&iacute;) from that of the R&aacute;v&iacute;. After entering Kashm&iacute;r it crosses
the Chen&aacute;b near the Kolahoi cone (17,900 feet) and the head waters of
the Jhelam. Thence it continues west over Haramukh (16,900 feet), which
casts its shadow southwards on the Wular lake, to the valley of the
Kishnganga, and probably across it to the mountains which flank the
magnificent K&aacute;gan glen in Haz&acirc;ra.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Outer Him&aacute;laya or Dhauladh&aacute;r-Pir Panj&aacute;l Range.</b>&mdash;The Outer Him&aacute;laya also
starts from a point near the Rotang pass, but some way to the south of
the offset of the Mid Himalayan chain. Its main axis runs parallel to
the latter, and under the name of the Dhauladh&aacute;r (white ridge) forms the
boundary of the Chamba State and K&aacute;ngra, behind whose headquarters, at
Dharms&aacute;la it stands up like a huge wall. It has a mean elevation of
15,000 feet, but rises as high as 16,000. It passes from Chamba into
Bhadarw&aacute;h in Kashm&iacute;r, and crossing the Chen&aacute;b is carried on as the P&iacute;r
Panj&aacute;l range through the south of that State. With an elevation of only
14,000 or 15,000 feet it is a dwarf as compared with the giants of the
Inner Himalayan and Muztagh-Karakoram chains. But it hides them from the
dwellers in the Panj&aacute;b, and its snowy crest is a very striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> picture
as seen in the cold weather from the plains of R&aacute;walpind&iacute;, Jhelam, and
Gujr&aacute;t. The Outer Him&aacute;laya is continued beyond the gorges of the Jhelam
and Kishnganga rivers in Kajn&aacute;g and the hills of the Haz&aacute;ra district.
Near the eastern extremity of the Dhauladh&aacute;r section of the Outer
Him&aacute;laya it sends out southwards between Kulu and Mand&iacute; a lower
offshoot. This is crossed by the Babbu (9480 feet) and Dulch&iacute; passes,
connecting Kulu with K&aacute;ngra through Mand&iacute;. Geologically the Kulu-Mand&iacute;
range appears to be continued to the east of the Bi&aacute;s and across the
Sutlej over Hattu and the Chor to the hills near Mas&uacute;r&iacute; (Mussoorie), a
well-known hill station in the United Provinces. Another offshoot at the
western end of the Dhauladh&aacute;r passes through the beautiful hill station
of Dalhousie, and sinks into the low hills to the east of the R&aacute;v&iacute;,
where it leaves Chamba and enters the British district of Gurd&aacute;spur.</p>

<p><b>River Valleys and Passes in the Him&aacute;laya.</b>&mdash;While these principal chains
can be traced from south-east to north-west over hundreds of miles it
must be remembered that the Him&aacute;laya is a mountain mass from 150 to 200
miles broad, that the main axes are linked together by subsidiary cross
chains dividing the head waters of great rivers, and flanked by long and
lofty ridges running down at various angles to the gorges of these
streams and their tributaries. The typical Himalayan river runs in a
gorge with mountains dipping down pretty steeply to its sides. The lower
slopes are cultivated, but the land is usually stony and uneven, and as
a whole the crops are not of a high class. The open valleys of the
Jhelam in Kashm&iacute;r and of the Bi&aacute;s in Kulu are exceptions. Passes in the
Him&aacute;laya are not defiles between high cliffs, but cross the crest of a
ridge at a point where the chain is locally depressed, and snow melts
soonest. In the Outer and Mid Him&aacute;laya the line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> of perpetual snow is at
about 16,000 feet, but for six months of the year the snow-line comes
down 5000 feet lower. In the Inner Him&aacute;laya and the Muztagh-Karakoram,
to which the monsoon does not penetrate, the air is so dry that less
snow falls and the line is a good deal higher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><b>Himalayan Scenery.</b>&mdash;Certain things strike any observant traveller in the
Him&aacute;laya. One is the comparative absence of running or still water,
except in the height of the rainy season, away from the large rivers.
The slope is so rapid that ordinary falls of rain run off with great
rapidity. The mountain scenery is often magnificent and the forests are
beautiful, but the absence of water robs the landscape of a charm which
would make it really perfect. Where this too is present, as in the
valley of the Bi&aacute;s in Kulu and those of the Jhelam and its tributaries
in Kashm&iacute;r and Haz&aacute;ra, the eye has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> its full fruition of content.
Another is the silence of the forests. Bird and beast are there, but
they are little in evidence. A third feature which can hardly be missed
is the contrast between the northern and the southern slopes. The former
will often be clothed with forest while the latter is a bare stony slope
covered according to season with brown or green grass interspersed with
bushes of indigo, barberry, or the hog plum (Prinsepia utilis). The
reason is that the northern side enjoys much more shade, snow lies
longer, and the supply of moisture is therefore greater. The grazier for
the same reason is less tempted to fire the hill side in order to
promote the growth of grass, a practice which is fatal to all forest
growth. The rich and varied flora of the Him&aacute;laya will be referred to
later.</p>

<p><b>Muztagh-Karakoram Ranges.</b>&mdash;The Muztagh-Karakoram mountains form the
northern watershed of the Indus. The range consists of more than one
main axis. The name Karakoram is appropriated to the eastern part of the
system which originates at E. longitude 79&deg; near the Pangong lake in the
Tibetan plateau a little beyond the boundary of Kashm&iacute;r. Beyond the
Karakoram pass (18,550 ft.) is a lofty bleak upland with salt lakes
dotted over its surface. Through this inhospitable region and over the
Karakoram pass and the Sasser-l&aacute; (17,500 ft.) the trade route from
Yarkand to Leh runs. The road is only open for three months in the year,
and the dangers and hardships are great. In 1898 Dr Bullock Workman and
his wife marched along it across the Shyok river, up the valley of the
Nubra, and over the Sasser-l&aacute; to the Karakoram pass. The scenery is an
exaggeration of that described by Dr Neve as seen on the road from the
Zoji-l&aacute; to Leh. There is a powerful picture of its weird repellent
grandeur in the Workmans' book entitled <i>In the Ice World of Him&aacute;laya</i>
(pp. 28-29, 30-32). The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> poet who had found ideas for a new Paradiso in
the Vale of Kashm&iacute;r might here get suggestions for a new Inferno.</p>

<p>The Karakoram range culminates in the north-west near the Muztagh pass
in a group of majestic peaks including K 2 or Mount Godwin Austen
(28,265 feet), Gasherbrum, and Masherbrum, which tower over and feed the
vast Boltoro glacier. The first of these giants is the second largest
mountain in the world. The Duke of the Abruzzi ascended it to the height
of 24,600 feet, and so established a climbing record. The Muztagh chain
carries on the northern bastion to the valley of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> the Hunza river and
the western extremity of the Hindu Kush. It has several peaks exceeding
25,000 feet. The most famous is Rakiposhi which looks down on Hunza from
a height of 25,550 feet.</p>

<p><b>The Hindu Kush.</b>&mdash;The Muztagh chain from the south-east, the Sarikol from
the north-east, and the Hindu Kush from the south-west, meet at a point
to the north of Hunza. The last runs westward and south-westward for
about 200 miles to the Dorah pass (14,800 feet), separating the valleys
which drain into the Indus from the head waters of the Oxus, and Hunza
and Gilgit in Kashm&iacute;r and Chitr&aacute;l in British India from the Afgh&aacute;n
province of Wakhan. The highest point in the main axis, Sad Istragh
(24,171 feet), is in this section. But the finest mountain scenery in
the Hindu Kush is in the great spurs it thrusts out southwards to flank
the glens which feed the Gilgit and Chitr&aacute;l rivers. Tirach M&iacute;r towers
above Chitr&aacute;l to a height of 25,426 feet. From Tibet to the Dorah pass
the northern frontier of India is impregnable. It is pierced by one or
two difficult trade routes strewn with the bones of pack animals, but no
large army has ever marched across it for the invasion of India. West of
the Dorah pass the general level of the Hindu Kush is a good deal lower
than that of its eastern section. The vital point in the defences of
India in this quarter lies near Charik&aacute;r to the north of K&aacute;bul, where
the chain thins out, and three practicable passes debouch on the valley
of the K&aacute;bul river. It is this fact that gives the town of K&aacute;bul its
great strategic importance. The highest of the three passes, the Kaoshan
or Hindu Kush (dead Hindu), crosses the chain at an elevation of 14,340
feet. It took its own name from the fate that befel a Hindu army when
attempting to cross it, and has handed it on to the whole range. It is
the pass which the armies of Alexander<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> and B&aacute;bar used. The historical
road for the invasion of India on this side has been by Charik&aacute;r and the
valley of the K&aacute;bul river to its junction with the Kunar below
Jal&aacute;l&aacute;b&aacute;d, thence up the Kunar valley and over one of the practicable
passes which connect its eastern watershed with the Panjkora and Sw&aacute;t
river valleys, whence the descent on Pesh&aacute;war is easy. This is the route
by which Alexander led the wing of the Grecian army which he commanded
in person, and the one followed by B&aacute;bar in 1518-19. Like Alexander,
B&aacute;bar fought his way through Bajaur, and crossed the Indus above Attock.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Khaibar.</b>&mdash;A British force advancing on K&aacute;bul from Pesh&aacute;war has never
marched by the Kunar and K&aacute;bul valley route. It has always taken the
Khaibar road, which only follows the Kabul river for less than one-third
of the 170 miles which separate Pesh&aacute;war from the Amir's capital. The
military road from Pesh&aacute;war to Landikh&aacute;na lies far to the south of the
river, from which it is shut off by difficult and rugged country held by
the Mohmands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Safed Koh.</b>&mdash;From Landikh&aacute;na the political boundary runs south-west to
the Safed Koh (white mountain) and is continued westwards along that
range to the Paiwar Kotal or pass (8450 feet). The Safed Koh forms the
watershed of the K&aacute;bul and Kurram rivers. It is a fine pine clad chain
with a general level of 12,000 feet, and its skyline is rarely free from
snow. It culminates in the west near Paiwar Kotal in Sikar&aacute;m (15,620
feet). To the west of the Pesh&aacute;war and Koh&aacute;t districts is a tangle of
hills and valleys formed by outlying spurs of the Safed Koh. This
difficult country is in the occupation of Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s and Orakzais, who are
under our political control.</p>

<p><b>The Kurram Valley.</b>&mdash;The line of advance into Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n through the
Kurram valley is easy, and Lord Roberts used it when he marched towards
K&aacute;bul in 1898. After the war we annexed the valley, leaving however the
head waters of the Kurram in Afgh&aacute;n territory. The road to K&aacute;bul leaves
the river far to the south before it crosses our frontier at Paiwar
Kotal.</p>

<p><b>Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n Hills.</b>&mdash;Between the Kurram valley and the Gomal river is a
large block of very rough mountainous country known as Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n from
the turbulent clan which occupies it. In the north it is drained by the
Toch&iacute;. Westwards of the Toch&iacute; valley the country rises into lofty
mountains. The upper waters of the Toch&iacute; and its affluents drain two
fine glens known as Birmal and Shawal to the west of the country of the
Mahsud Waz&iacute;rs. The Toch&iacute; valley is the direct route from India to
Ghazn&iacute;, and nine centuries ago, when that decayed town was the capital
of a powerful kingdom, it must often have heard the tramp of armed men.
The loftiest peaks in Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n, Shuid&aacute;r (11,000 feet) and P&iacute;rghal
(11,600 feet), overhang Birmal. Further south, W&aacute;na, our post in
south-west Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n, overlooks from its plateau the Gomal valley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Gomal Pass as a trade route.</b>&mdash;East of Kaj&uacute;r&iacute; Kach the Gomal flows
through tribal territory to the Gomal pass from which it debouches into
the plains of the Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n district. "The Gomal route is the
oldest of all trade routes. Down it there yearly pours a succession of
<i>k&aacute;filas</i> (caravans) led and followed up by thousands of well-armed
Path&aacute;n traders, called Powindahs, from the plains of Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n to
India. The Powindahs mostly belong to the Ghilzai tribes, and are not
therefore true Afgh&aacute;ns<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Leaving their women and children encamped
within British territory on our border, and their arms in the keeping of
our frontier political officials, the Powindah makes his way southwards
with his camel loads of fruit and silk, bales of camel and goat hair or
sheepskin goods, carpets and other merchandise from K&aacute;bul and Bokh&aacute;ra,
and conveys himself through the length and breadth of the Indian
peninsula.... He returns yearly to the cool summits of the Afgh&aacute;n hills
and the open grassy plains, where his countless flocks of sheep and
camels are scattered for the summer grazing" (Holdich's <i>India</i>, pp.
80-81).</p>

<p><b>Physical features of hilly country between Pesh&aacute;war and the Gomal
river.</b>&mdash;The physical features of the hill country between Pesh&aacute;war and
the Gomal pass may best be described in the words of Sir Thomas Holdich:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Natural landscape beauty, indeed, may here be measured to a
certain extent by altitude. The low ranges of sun-scorched,
blackened ridge and furrow formation which form the approaches to
the higher altitudes of the Afgh&aacute;n upland, and which are almost as
regularly laid out by the hand of nature in some parts of the
frontier as are the parallels ... of the engineer who is besieging
a fortress&mdash;these are by no means 'things of beauty,' and it is
this class of formation and this form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> of barren desolation that is
most familiar to the frontier officer.... Shades of delicate purple
and grey will not make up for the absence of the living green of
vegetation.... But with higher altitudes a cooler climate and
snow-fed soil is found, and as soon as vegetation grasps a
root-hold there is the beginning of fine scenery. The upper
pine-covered slopes of the Safed Koh are as picturesque as those of
the Swiss Alps; they are crowned by peaks whose wonderful altitudes
are frozen beyond the possibility of vegetation, and are usually
covered with snow wherever snow can lie. In Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n, hidden away
in the higher recesses of its great mountains, are many valleys of
great natural beauty, where we find the spreading poplar and the
ilex in all the robust growth of an indigenous flora.... Among the
minor valleys Birmal perhaps takes precedence by right of its
natural beauty. Here are stretches of park-like scenery where
grass-covered slopes are dotted with clumps of <i>deod&aacute;r</i> and pine
and intersected with rivulets hidden in banks of fern; soft green
glades open out to view from every turn in the folds of the hills,
and above them the silent watch towers of P&iacute;rghal and Shuid&aacute;r ...
look down from their snow-clad heights across the Afgh&aacute;n uplands to
the hills beyond Ghazn&iacute;." (Holdich's <i>India</i>, pp. 81-82.)</p></div>

<p><b>The Sulim&aacute;n Range.</b>&mdash;A well-marked mountain chain runs from the Gomal to
the extreme south-west corner of the Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n district where the
borders of Biluchist&aacute;n, Sind, and the Panj&aacute;b meet. It culminates forty
miles south of the Gomal in the fine Kaisargarh mountain (11,295 feet),
which is a very conspicuous object from the plains of the Deraj&aacute;t. On
the side of Kaisargarh there is a shrine called Takht i Sulim&aacute;n or
Throne of Solomon, and this is the name by which Englishmen usually know
the mountain, and which has been passed on to the whole range.
Proceeding southwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> the general elevation of the chain drops
steadily. But Fort Munro, the hill station of the Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n
district, 200 miles south of the Takht, still stands 6300 feet above sea
level, and it looks across at the fine peak of Ekbhai, which is more
than 1000 feet higher. In the south of the Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n district the
general level of the chain is low, arid the Giand&aacute;ri hill, though only
4160 feet above the sea, stands out conspicuously. Finally near where
the three jurisdictions meet the hills melt into the Kachh Gand&aacute;va
plain. Sir Thomas Holdich's description of the rugged Path&aacute;n hills
applies also to the Sulim&aacute;n range. Kaisargarh is a fine limestone
mountain crowned by a forest of the edible <i>chilgoza</i> pine. But the
ordinary tree growth, where found at all, is of a much humbler kind,
consisting of gnarled olives and dwarf palms.</p>

<p><b>Passes and torrents in Sulim&aacute;n Hills.</b>&mdash;The drainage of the western
slopes of the Sulim&aacute;n range finding no exit on that side has had to wear
out ways for itself towards the plains which lie between the foot of the
hills and the Indus. This is the explanation of the large number of
passes, about one hundred, which lead from the plains into the Sulim&aacute;n
hills. The chief from north to south are the Vehoa, the Sangarh, the
Khair, the Kah&aacute;, the Ch&aacute;char, and the Sir&iacute;, called from the torrents
which flow through them to the plains. There is an easy route through
the Ch&aacute;char to Biluchist&aacute;n. But unfortunately the water of the torrent
is brackish.</p>

<p><b>Sub Him&aacute;laya or Siw&aacute;liks.</b>&mdash;In its lowest ridges the Him&aacute;laya drops to a
height of about 5000 feet. But the traveller to any of the summer
resorts in the mountains passes through a zone of lower hills
interspersed sometimes with valleys or "duns." These consist of Tertiary
sandstones, clays, and boulder conglomerates, the d&eacute;bris in fact which
the Him&aacute;laya has dropped in the course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> of ages. To this group of hills
and valleys the general name of Siw&aacute;liks is given. East of the Jhelam it
includes the N&aacute;han hills to the north of Amb&aacute;la, the low hills of
K&aacute;ngra, Hoshy&aacute;rpur, Gurd&aacute;spur, and Jammu, and the P&aacute;bb&iacute; hills in Gujr&aacute;t.
But it is to the west of the Jhelam that the system has its greatest
extension. Practically the whole of the soil of the plains of the
Attock, R&aacute;walpindi, and Jhelam districts consists of disintegrated
Siw&aacute;lik sandstone, and differs widely in appearance and agricultural
quality from the alluvium of the true Panj&aacute;b plains. The low hills of
these districts belong to the same system, but the Salt Range is only in
part Siw&aacute;lik. Altogether Siw&aacute;lik deposits in the Panj&aacute;b cover an area of
13,000 square miles. Beyond the Indus the hills of the Koh&aacute;t district
and a part of the Sulim&aacute;n range are of Tertiary age.</p>

<p><b>The Great Panj&aacute;b Plain.</b>&mdash;The passage from the highlands to the plains is
as a rule abrupt, and the contrast between the two is extraordinary.
This is true without qualification of the tract between the Jamna and
the Jhelam. It is equally true of British districts west of the Jhelam
and south of the Salt Range and of lines drawn from K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh on the west
bank of the Indus southwards to Pani&aacute;la and thence north-west through
the Pezu pass to the Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n hills. In all that vast plain, if we
except the insignificant hills in the extreme south-west of the province
ending to the north in the historic ridge at Delhi, some hillocks of
gneiss near Tosh&aacute;m in Hiss&aacute;r, and the curious little isolated rocks at
Kir&aacute;na, Chiniot, and S&aacute;ngla near the Chen&aacute;b and Jhelam, the only
eminences are petty ridges of windblown sand and the "<i>thehs</i>" or mounds
which represent the accumulated d&eacute;bris of ancient village sites. At the
end of the Jurassic period and later this great plain was part of a sea
bed. Far removed as the Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> ocean now is the height above sea level
of the Panj&aacute;b plain east of the Jhelam is nowhere above 1000 feet. Delhi
and Lahore are both just above the 700 feet line. The hills mentioned
above are humble time-worn outliers of the very ancient Aravalli system,
to which the hills of R&aacute;jput&aacute;na belong. Kir&aacute;na and S&aacute;ngla were already
of enormous age, when they were islands washed by the waves of the
Tertiary sea. A description of the different parts of the vast Panj&aacute;b
plain, its great stretches of firm loam, and its tracts of sand and sand
hills, which the casual observer might regard as pure desert, will be
given in the paragraphs devoted to the different districts.</p>

<p><b>The Salt Range.</b>&mdash;The tract west of the Jhelam, and bounded on the south
by the Salt Range cis-Indus, and trans-Indus by the lines mentioned
above, is of a more varied character. Time worn though the Salt Range
has become by the waste of ages, it still rises at Sakesar, near its
western extremity, to a height of 5000 feet. The eastern part of the
range is mostly in the Jhelam district, and there the highest point is
Chail (3700 feet). The hill of Tilla (3242 feet), which is a marked
feature of the landscape looking westwards from Jhelam cantonment, is on
a spur running north-east from the main chain. The Salt Range is poorly
wooded, the dwarf acacia or <i>phul&aacute;h&iacute;</i> (Acacia modesta), the olive, and
the <i>sanattha</i> shrub (Dodonea viscosa) are the commonest species. But
these jagged and arid hills include some not infertile valleys, every
inch of which is put under crop by the crowded population. To geologists
the range is of special interest, including as it does at one end of the
scale Cambrian beds of enormous antiquity and at the other rocks of
Tertiary age. Embedded in the Cambrian strata there are great deposits
of rock salt at Kheora, where the Mayo mine is situated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> At K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh
the Salt Range reappears on the far side of the Indus. Here the salt
comes to the surface, and its jagged pinnacles present a remarkable
appearance.</p>

<p><b>Country north of the Salt Range.</b>&mdash;The country to the north of the Salt
Range included in the districts of Jhelam, R&aacute;walpind&iacute;, and Attock is
often ravine-bitten and seamed with the white sandy beds of torrents.
Generally speaking it is an arid precarious tract, but there are fertile
stretches which will be mentioned in the descriptions of the districts.
The general height of the plains north of the Salt Range is from 1000
feet to 2000 feet above sea level. The rise between Lahore and
R&aacute;walpind&iacute; is just over a thousand feet. Low hills usually form a
feature of the landscape, pleasing at a distance or when softened by the
evening light, but bare and jagged on a nearer view. The chief hills are
the M&aacute;rgalla range between Haz&aacute;ra and R&aacute;walpind&iacute;, the K&aacute;lachitta and the
Khairimurat hills running east and west through Attock and the very dry
and broken Narrara hills on the right bank of the Indus in the same
district. Between the M&aacute;rgalla and K&aacute;lachitta hills is the M&aacute;rgalla pass
on the main road from R&aacute;walpind&iacute; to the passage of the Indus at Attock,
and therefore a position of considerable strategical importance. The
K&aacute;lachitta (black and white) chain is so called because the north side
is formed of nummulitic limestone and the south mainly of a dark purple
sandstone. The best tree-growth is therefore on the north side.</p>

<p><b>Pesh&aacute;war, Koh&aacute;t, and Bannu.</b>&mdash;Across the Indus the Pesh&aacute;war and Bannu
districts are basins ringed with hills and drained respectively by the
K&aacute;bul and Kurram rivers with their affluents. Between these two basins
lies the maze of bare broken hills and valleys which make up the Koh&aacute;t
district. The cantonment of Koh&aacute;t is 1700 feet above sea level and no
hill in the district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> reaches 5000 feet. Near the Koh&aacute;t border in the
south-west of the Pesh&aacute;war district are the Khattak hills, the
culmination of which at Ghaibana Sir has a height of 5136 feet, and the
military sanitarium of Cher&aacute;t in the same chain is 600 feet lower. On
the east the Maid&aacute;ni hills part Bannu from Isakhel, the trans-Indus
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i> of Mianw&aacute;li, and on the south the Marwat hills divide it from
Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n. Both are humble ranges. The highest point in the
Marwat hills is Shekhbud&iacute;n, a bare and dry limestone rock rising to an
elevation of over 4500 feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3>RIVERS</h3>


<p><b>The Panj&aacute;b Rivers.</b>&mdash;"Panj&aacute;b" is a Persian compound word, meaning "five
waters," and strictly speaking the word denotes the country between the
valley of the Jhelam and that of the Sutlej. The intermediate rivers
from west to east are the Chen&aacute;b, the R&aacute;v&iacute;, and the Bi&aacute;s. Their combined
waters at last flow into the Panjnad or "five rivers" at the south-west
corner of the Mult&aacute;n district, and the volume of water which 44 miles
lower down the Panjnad carries into the Indus is equal to the discharge
of the latter. The first Aryan settlers knew this part of India as the
land of the seven rivers (<i>sapla sindhavas</i>), adding to the five
mentioned above the Indus and the Sarasvat&iacute;. The old Vedic name is more
appropriate than Panj&aacute;b if we substitute the Jamna for the Sarasvat&iacute; or
Sarust&iacute;, which is now a petty stream.</p>

</div>


<p><b>River Valleys.</b>&mdash;The cold weather traveller who is carried from Delhi to
R&aacute;walpind&iacute; over the great railway bridges at points chosen because there
the waters of the rivers are confined by nature, or can be confined by
art, within moderate limits, has little idea of what one of these rivers
is like in flood time. He sees that, even at such favoured spots,
between the low banks there is a stretch of sand far exceeding in width
the main channel, where a considerable volume of water is running, and
the minor depressions, in which a sluggish and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> shallow flow may still
be found. If, leaving the railway, he crosses a river by some bridge of
boats or local ferry, he will find still wider expanses of sand
sometimes bare and dry and white, at others moist and dark and covered
with dwarf tamarisk. He may notice that, before he reaches the sand and
the tamarisk scrub, he leaves by a gentle or abrupt descent the dry
uplands, and passes into a lower, greener, and perhaps to his
inexperienced eye more fertile seeming tract. This is the valley, often
miles broad, through which the stream has moved in ever-shifting
channels in the course of centuries. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> finds it hard to realize that,
when the summer heats melt the Himalayan snows, and the monsoon
currents, striking against the northern mountain walls, are precipitated
in torrents of rain, the rush of water to the plains swells the river
20, 30, 40, or even 50 fold. The sandy bed then becomes full from bank
to bank, and the silt laden waters spill over into the cultivated
lowlands beyond. Accustomed to the stable streams of his own land, he
cannot conceive the risks the riverside farmer in the Panj&aacute;b runs of
having fruitful fields smothered in a night with barren sand, or lands
and well and house sucked into the river-bed. So great and sudden are
the changes, bad and good, wrought by river action that the loss and
gain have to be measured up year by year for revenue purposes. Nor is
the visitor likely to imagine that the main channel may in a few seasons
become a quite subsidiary or wholly deserted bed. Like all streams, e.g.
the Po, which flow from the mountains into a flat terrain, the Panj&aacute;b
rivers are perpetually silting up their beds, and thus, by their own
action, becoming diverted into new channels or into existing minor ones,
which are scoured out afresh. If our traveller, leaving the railway at
R&aacute;walpindi, proceeds by tonga to the capital of Kashm&iacute;r, he will find
between Koh&aacute;la and B&aacute;ram&uacute;la another surprise awaiting him. The noble but
sluggish river of the lowlands, which he crossed at the town of Jhelam,
is here a swift and deep torrent, flowing over a boulder bed, and
swirling round waterworn rocks in a gorge hemmed in by mountains. That
is the typical state of the Himalayan rivers, though the same Jhelam
above B&aacute;ram&uacute;la is an exception, flowing there sluggishly through a very
flat valley into a shallow lake.</p>

<p><b>The Indus Basin.</b>&mdash;The river Sindh (Sanskrit, Sindhu), more familiar to
us under its classical name of the Indus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> must have filled with
astonishment every invader from the west, and it is not wonderful that
they called after it the country that lay beyond. Its basin covers an
area of 373,000 square miles. Confining attention to Asia these figures,
large though they seem, are far exceeded by those of the Yangtsze-Kiang.
The area of which a description is attempted in this book is, with the
exception of a strip along the Jamna and the part of Kashm&iacute;r lying
beyond the Muztagh-Karakoram range, all included in the Indus basin. But
it does not embrace the whole of it. Part is in Tibet, part in
Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n and Biluchist&aacute;n, and part in Sindh, through which province
the Indus flows for 450 miles, or one-quarter of its whole course of
1800 miles. It seems likely that the Jamna valley was not always an
exception, or at least that that river once flowed westwards through
R&aacute;jput&aacute;na to the Indian ocean. The five great rivers of the Panj&aacute;b all
drain into the Indus, and the Ghagar with its tributary, the Sarust&iacute;,
which now, even when in flood, loses itself in the sands of Bikaner,
probably once flowed down the old Hakra bed in Bah&aacute;walpur either into
the Indus or by an independent bed now represented by an old flood
channel of the Indus in Sindh, the Hakro or Nara, which passes through
the Rann of Kachh.</p>

<p><b>The Indus outside British India.</b>&mdash;To the north of the Manasarowar lake
in Tibet is Kail&aacute;s, the Hindu Olympus. On the side of this mountain the
Indus is said to rise at a height of 17,000 feet. After a course of 200
miles or more it crosses the south-east boundary of the Kashm&iacute;r State at
an elevation of 13,800 feet. From the Kashm&iacute;r frontier to Mt Haramosh
west of Gilgit it flows steadily to the north-west for 350 miles. After
125 miles Leh, the capital of Lad&aacute;kh, is reached at a height of 10,500
feet, and here the river is crossed by the trade route to Yarkand. A
little below Leh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> the Indus receives the Z&aacute;nskar, which drains the
south-east of Kashm&iacute;r. After another 150 miles it flows through the
basin, in which Skardo, the principal town in Baltist&aacute;n, is situated.
Above Skardo a large tributary, the Shyok, flows in from the east at an
elevation of 8000 feet. The Shyok and its affluent, the Nubra, rise in
the giant glaciers to the south-west of the Karakoram pass. After the
Skardo basin is left behind the descent is rapid. The river rushes down
a tremendous gorge, where it appears to break through the western
Him&aacute;laya, skirts Haramosh, and at a point twenty-five miles east of
Gilgit bends abruptly to the south. Shortly after it is joined from the
west by the Gilgit river, and here the bed is about 4000 feet above sea
level. Continuing to flow south for another twenty miles it resumes its
westernly course to the north of Nanga Parvat and persists in it for 100
miles. Our political post of Chil&aacute;s lies in this section on the south
bank. Fifty or sixty miles west of Chil&aacute;s the Indus turns finally to the
south. From J&aacute;lkot, where the Kashm&iacute;r frontier is left, to Palos&iacute; below
the Mahaban mountain it flows for a hundred miles through territory over
which we only exercise political control. Near Palos&iacute;, 812 miles from
the source, the river enters British India. In Kashm&iacute;r the Indus and the
Shyok in some places flow placidly over alluvial flats, and at others
with a rapid and broken current through narrow gorges. At Skardo their
united stream is said, even in winter, to be 500 feet wide and nine or
ten feet deep. If one of the deep gorges, as sometimes happens, is
choked by a landslip, the flood that follows when the barrier finally
bursts may spread devastation hundreds of miles away. To the north of
the fertile Chach plain in Attock there is a wide stretch of land along
the Indus, which still shows in its stony impoverished soil the effects
of the great flood of 1841.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Indus in British India.</b>&mdash;After reaching British India the Indus soon
becomes the boundary dividing Haz&aacute;ra and Pesh&aacute;war, two districts of the
North West Frontier Province. Lower down it parts Pesh&aacute;war from the
Panj&aacute;b district of Attock. In this section after a time the hills recede
on both sides, and the stream is wide and so shallow that it is fordable
in places in the cold weather. There are islands, ferry boats and rafts
can ply, and the only danger is from sudden freshets. Ohind, where
Alexander crossed, is in this section. A more famous passage is at
Attock just below the junction of the K&aacute;bul river. Here the heights
again approach the Indus on either bank. The volume of water is vastly
increased by the union of the K&aacute;bul river, which brings down the whole
drainage of the southern face of the Hindu Kush. From the north it
receives near Jal&aacute;l&aacute;b&aacute;d the Kunar river, and near Charsadda in Pesh&aacute;war
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> Sw&aacute;t, which with its affluent the Panjkora drains D&iacute;r, Bajaur, and
Sw&aacute;t. In the cold weather looking northwards from the Attock fort one
sees the K&aacute;bul or Landai as a blue river quietly mingling with the
Indus, and in the angle between them a stretch of white sand. But during
floods the junction is the scene of a wild turmoil of waters. At Attock
there are a railway bridge, a bridge of boats, and a ferry. The bed of
the stream is 2000 feet over sea level. For ninety miles below Attock
the river is confined between bare and broken hills, till it finally
emerges into the plains from the gorge above K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh, where the Salt
Range impinges on the left bank. Between Attock and K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh the right
bank is occupied by Pesh&aacute;war and Koh&aacute;t and the left by Attock and
Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;. In this section the Indus is joined by the Haro and So&aacute;n
torrents, and spanned at Khush&aacute;lgarh by a railway bridge. This is the
only other masonry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> bridge crossing it in the Panj&aacute;b. Elsewhere the
passage has to be made by ferry boats or by boat bridges, which are
taken down in the rainy season. At K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh the height above sea level
is less than 1000 feet. When it passes the western extremity of the Salt
Range the river spreads out into a wide lake-like expanse of waters. It
has now performed quite half of its long journey. Henceforth it receives
no addition from the east till the Panjnad in the south-west corner of
the Muzaffargarh district brings to it the whole tribute of the five
rivers of the Panj&aacute;b. Here, though the Indian ocean is still 500 miles
distant, the channel is less than 300 feet above the sea. From the west
it receives an important tributary in the Kurram, which, with its
affluent the Toch&iacute;, rises in Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n. The torrents from the Sulim&aacute;n
Range are mostly used up for irrigation before they reach the Indus, but
some of them mingle their waters with it in high floods. Below K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh
the Indus is a typical lowland river of great size, with many sandy
islands in the bed and a wide valley subject to its inundations.
Opposite Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n the valley is seventeen miles across. As a
plains river the Indus runs at first through the Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; district of
the Panj&aacute;b, then divides Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; from Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n, and lastly
parts Muzaffargarh and the Bah&aacute;walpur State from the Panj&aacute;b frontier
district of Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n.</p>

<p><b>The Jhelam.</b>&mdash;The Jhelam, the most westernly of the five rivers of the
Panj&aacute;b, is called the Veth in Kashmir and locally in the Panj&aacute;b plains
the Vehat. These names correspond to the Bihat of the Muhammadan
historians and the Hydaspes of the Greeks, and all go back to the
Sanskrit Vitasta. Issuing from a deep pool at Vern&aacute;g to the east of
Isl&aacute;m&aacute;b&aacute;d in Kashm&iacute;r it becomes navigable just below that town, and
flows north-west in a lazy stream for 102 miles through Sr&iacute;nagar, the
summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> capital, into the Wular lake, and beyond it to B&aacute;ram&uacute;la. The
banks are quite low and often cultivated to the river's edge. But across
the flat valley there is on either side a splendid panorama of
mountains. From B&aacute;ram&uacute;la the character of the Jhelam suddenly changes,
and for the next 70 miles to Koh&aacute;la, where the traveller crosses by a
fine bridge into the Panj&aacute;b, it rushes down a deep gorge, whose sides
are formed by the Kajn&aacute;g mountains on the right, and the P&iacute;r Panj&aacute;l on
the left, bank. Between B&aacute;ram&uacute;la and Koh&aacute;la there is a drop from 5000 to
2000 feet. At Domel, the stage before Koh&aacute;la the Jhelam receives from
the north the waters of the Kishnganga, and lower down it is joined by
the Kunh&aacute;r, which drains the K&aacute;gan glen in Haz&aacute;ra. A little above Koh&aacute;la
it turns sharply to the south, continuing its character as a mountain
stream hemmed in by the hills of R&aacute;walpind&iacute; on the right bank and of the
P&uacute;nch State on the left. The hills gradually sink lower and lower, but
on the left side only disappear a little above the cantonment of Jhelam,
where there is a noble railway bridge. From Jhelam onwards the river is
of the usual plains' type. After dividing the districts of Jhelam (right
bank) and Gujr&aacute;t (left), it flows through the Sh&aacute;hpur and Jhang
districts, falling finally into the Chen&aacute;b at Trimmu, 450 miles from its
source. There is a second railway bridge at Haranpur on the Sind S&aacute;gar
line, and a bridge of boats at Khush&aacute;b, in the Sh&aacute;hpur district. The
noblest and most-varied scenery in the north-west Himalaya is in the
catchment area of the Jhelam. The Kashm&iacute;r valley and the valleys which
drain into the Jhelam from the north, the Liddar, the Lol&aacute;b, the Sind,
and the K&aacute;gan glen, display a wealth of beauty unequalled elsewhere. Nor
does this river wholly lose its association with beauty in the plains.
Its very rich silt gives the lands on its banks the green charm of rich
crops and pleasant trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Chen&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;The Chen&aacute;b (more properly Ch&iacute;n&aacute;b or river of China) is the
Asikn&iacute; of the Vedas and the Akesines of the Greek historians. It is
formed by the union of the Chandra and Bh&aacute;ga, both of which rise in
Lahul near the B&aacute;ral&aacute;cha pass. Having become the Chandrabh&aacute;ga the river
flows through P&aacute;ng&iacute; in Chamba and the south-east of Kashm&iacute;r. Near
Kishtw&aacute;r it breaks through the P&iacute;r Panj&aacute;l range, and thenceforwards
receives the drainage of its southern slopes. At Akhn&uacute;r it becomes
navigable and soon after it enters the Panj&aacute;b district of Si&aacute;lkot. A
little later it is joined from the west by the Taw&iacute;, the stream above
which stands Jammu, the winter capital of Kashm&iacute;r. The Chen&aacute;b parts
Si&aacute;lkot and Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la on the left bank from Gujr&aacute;t and Sh&aacute;hpur on the
right. At Waz&iacute;r&aacute;b&aacute;d, near the point where Si&aacute;lkot, Gujr&aacute;t, and
Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la meet, it is crossed by the Alexandra railway bridge. Leaving
Sh&aacute;hpur and Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la behind, the Chen&aacute;b flows through Jhang to its
junction with the Jhelam at Trimmu. In this section there is a second
railway bridge at Chund Bharw&aacute;na. The united stream runs on under the
name of Chen&aacute;b to be joined on the north border of the Mult&aacute;n district
by the R&aacute;v&iacute; and on its southern border by the Sutlej. Below its junction
with the latter the stream is known as the Panjnad. In the plains the
Chen&aacute;b cannot be called an attractive river, and its silt is far
inferior to that of the Jhelam.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 14. Fording the River at Lahore.</span>
</div>

<p><b>The R&aacute;v&iacute;.</b>&mdash;The R&aacute;v&iacute; was known to the writers of the Vedic hymns as the
Parushn&iacute;, but is called in classical Sanskrit Ir&aacute;vat&iacute;, whence the
Hydraotes of the Greek historians. It rises near the Rotang pass in
K&aacute;ngra, and flows north-west through the southern part of Chamba. Below
the town of Chamba, it runs as a swift slaty-blue mountain stream, and
here it is spanned by a fine bridge. Passing on to the north of the hill
station of Dalhousie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> it reaches the Kashmir border, and turning to the
south-west flows along it to Basol&iacute; where Kashm&iacute;r, Chamba, and the
British district of Gurd&aacute;spur meet. At this point it is 2000 feet above
the sea level. It now forms the boundary of Kashm&iacute;r and Gurd&aacute;spur, and
finally near Madhopur, where the head-works of the B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b canal are
situated, it passes into the Gurd&aacute;spur district. Shortly after it is
joined from the north by a large torrent called the Ujh, which rises in
the Jammu hills. After reaching the Si&aacute;lkot border the R&aacute;v&iacute; parts that
district first from Gurd&aacute;spur and then from Amritsar, and, passing
through the west of Lahore, divides Montgomery and Lyallpur, and flowing
through the north of Mult&aacute;n joins the Chen&aacute;b near the Jhang border. In
Mult&aacute;n there is a remarkable straight reach in the channel known as the
S&iacute;dhnai, which has been utilized for the site of the head-works of a
small canal. The Degh, a torrent which rises in the Jammu hills and has
a long course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> through the Si&aacute;lkot and Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la districts, joins the
R&aacute;v&iacute; when in flood in the north of the Lyallpur district. But its waters
will now be diverted into the river higher up in order to safeguard the
Upper Chen&aacute;b canal. Lahore is on the left bank of the R&aacute;v&iacute;. It is a mile
from the cold weather channel, but in high floods the waters have often
come almost up to the Fort. At Lahore the North Western Railway and the
Grand Trunk Road are carried over the R&aacute;v&iacute; by masonry bridges. There is
a second railway bridge over the S&iacute;dhnai reach in Mult&aacute;n. Though the
R&aacute;v&iacute;, like the Jhelam, has a course of 450 miles, it has a far smaller
catchment area, and is really a somewhat insignificant stream. In the
cold weather, the canal takes such a heavy toll from it that below
M&aacute;dhopur the supply of water is mainly drawn from the Ujh, and in
Montgomery one may cross the bed dryshod for months together. The valley
of the R&aacute;v&iacute; is far narrower than those of the rivers described in the
preceding paragraphs, and the floods are most uncertain, but when they
occur are of very great value.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 15. Bi&aacute;s at Man&aacute;l&iacute;.</span>
</div>


<p><b>The Bi&aacute;s.</b>&mdash;The Bi&aacute;s (Sanskrit, Vipasa; Greek, Hyphasis) rises near the
Rotang pass at a height of about 13,000 feet. Its head-waters are
divided from those of the R&aacute;v&iacute; by the Bara Bang&aacute;hal range. It flows for
about sixty miles through the beautiful Kulu valley to L&aacute;rj&iacute; (3000
feet). It has at first a rapid course, but before it reaches Sult&aacute;npur
(4000 feet), the chief village in Kulu, some thirty miles from the
source, it has become, at least in the cold weather, a comparatively
peaceful stream fringed with alder thickets. Heavy floods, however,
sometimes cover fields and orchards with sand and boulders. There is a
bridge at Man&aacute;l&iacute; (6100 feet), a very lovely spot, another below Nagar,
and a third at L&aacute;rj&iacute;. Near L&aacute;rj&iacute; the river turns to the west down a bold
ravine and becomes for a time the boundary between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> Kulu and the Mand&iacute;
State. Near the town of Mand&iacute;, where it is bridged, it bends again, and
winds in a north-west and westerly direction through low hills in the
south of K&aacute;ngra till it meets the Siw&aacute;liks on the Hoshy&aacute;rpur border. In
this reach there is a bridge of boats at Dera Gop&iacute;pur on the main road
from Jalandhar and Hoshy&aacute;rpur to Dharms&aacute;la. Elsewhere in the south of
K&aacute;ngra the traveller can cross without difficulty on a small bed
supported on inflated skins. Sweeping round the northern end of the
Siw&aacute;liks the Bi&aacute;s, having after long parting again approached within
about fifteen miles of the R&aacute;v&iacute;, turns definitely to the south, forming
henceforth the dividing line between Hoshy&aacute;rpur and Kap&uacute;rthala (left
bank) and Gurd&aacute;spur and Amritsar (right). Finally above the Harike ferry
at a point where Lahore, Amritsar, Ferozepur, and Kap&uacute;rthala nearly
meet, it falls into the Sutlej. The North Western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Railway crosses it by
a bridge near the Bi&aacute;s station and at the same place there is a bridge
of boats for the traffic on the Grand Trunk Road. The chief affluents
are the Chakk&iacute;, the torrent which travellers to Dharms&aacute;la cross by a
fine bridge twelve miles from the railhead at Path&aacute;nkot, and the Black
Bein in Hoshy&aacute;rpur and Kap&uacute;rthala. The latter is a winding drainage
channel, which starts in a swamp in the north of the Hoshy&aacute;rpur
district. The Bi&aacute;s has a total course of 390 miles. Only for about
eighty miles or so is it a true river of the plains, and its floods do
not spread far.</p>

<p><b>The Sutlej.</b>&mdash;The Sutlej is the Shatadru of Vedic hymns and the Zaradros
of Greek writers. The peasant of the Panj&aacute;b plains knows it as the N&iacute;l&iacute;
or Ghara. After the Indus it is the greatest of Panj&aacute;b rivers, and for
its source we have to go back to the Manasarowar lakes in Tibet. From
thence it flows for 200 miles in a north-westerly direction to the
British frontier near Shipk&iacute;. A little beyond the Spit&iacute; river brings it
the drainage of the large tract of that name in K&aacute;ngra and of part of
Western Tibet. From Shipk&iacute; it runs for forty miles in deep gorges
through Kun&aacute;war in the Bashahr State to Ch&iacute;n&iacute;, a beautiful spot near the
Wangtu bridge, where the Hindustan-Tibet road crosses to the left bank.
A little below Ch&iacute;n&iacute; the B&aacute;spa flows in from the southeast. The fall
between the source and Ch&iacute;n&iacute; is from 15,000 to 7500 feet. There is
magnificent cliff scenery at Rog&iacute; in this reach. Forty miles below Ch&iacute;n&iacute;
the capital of Bashahr, R&aacute;mpur, on the south bank, is only 3300 feet
above sea level. There is a second bridge at R&aacute;mpur, and from about this
point the river becomes the boundary of Bashahr and Kulu, the route to
which from Simla passes over the Lur&iacute; bridge (2650 feet) below N&aacute;rkanda.
Beyond Lur&iacute; the Sutlej runs among low hills through several of the Simla
Hill States. It pierces the Siw&aacute;liks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> at the Hoshy&aacute;rpur border and then
turns to the south, maintaining that trend till R&uacute;par and the head-works
of the Sirhind canal are reached. For the next hundred miles to the Bi&aacute;s
junction the general direction is west. Above the Harike ferry the
Sutlej again turns, and flows steadily, though with many windings, to
the south-west till it joins the Chen&aacute;b at the south corner of the
Mult&aacute;n district. There are railway bridges at Phillaur, Ferozepur, and
Adamw&aacute;han. In the plains the Sutlej districts are&mdash;on the right bank
Hoshy&aacute;rpur, Jalandhar, Lahore, and Montgomery, and on the left Amb&aacute;la,
Ludhi&aacute;na and Ferozepur. Below Ferozepur the river divides Montgomery and
Mult&aacute;n from Bah&aacute;walpur (left bank). The Sutle; has a course of 900
miles, and a large catchment area in the hills. Notwithstanding the
heavy toll taken by the Sirhind canal, its floods spread pretty far in
Jalandhar and Ludhi&aacute;na and below the Bi&aacute;s junction many monsoon canals
have been dug which inundate a large area in the lowlands of the
districts on either bank and of Bah&aacute;walpur. The dry bed of the Hakra,
which can be traced through Bah&aacute;walpur, Bikaner, and Sindh, formerly
carried the waters of the Sutlej to the sea.</p>

<p><b>The Ghagar and the Sarusti.</b>&mdash;The Ghagar, once a tributary of the Hakra,
rises within the Sirm&uacute;r State in the hills to the east of K&aacute;lka. A few
miles south of K&aacute;lka it crosses a narrow neck of the Amb&aacute;la district,
and the bridge on the Amb&aacute;la-Kalka railway is in this section. The rest
of its course, till it loses itself in the sands of Bikaner, is chiefly
in Pati&aacute;la and the Karn&aacute;l and Hiss&aacute;r districts. It is joined by the Umla
torrent in Karn&aacute;l and lower down the Sarust&iacute; unites with it in Pati&aacute;la
just beyond the Karn&aacute;l border. It is hard to believe that the Sarust&iacute; of
to-day is the famous Sarasvat&iacute; of the Vedas, though the little
ditch-like channel that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> bears the name certainly passes beside the
sacred sites of Thanesar and Pehowa. A small sandy torrent bearing the
same name rises in the low hills in the north-east of the Amb&aacute;la
district, but it is doubtful if its waters, which finally disappear into
the ground, ever reach the Thanesar channel. That seems rather to
originate in the overflow of a rice swamp in the plains, and in the cold
weather the bed is usually dry. In fact, till the Sarust&iacute; receives above
Pehowa the floods of the M&aacute;rkanda torrent, it is a most insignificant
stream. The M&aacute;rkanda, when in flood, carries a large volume of water,
and below the junction the small channel of the Sarust&iacute; cannot carry the
tribute received, which spreads out into a shallow lake called the
Sainsa <i>jh&iacute;l</i>. This has been utilized for the supply of the little
Sarust&iacute; canal, which is intended to do the work formerly effected in a
rude way by throwing <i>bands</i> or embankments across the bed of the
stream, and forcing the water over the surrounding lands. The same
wasteful form of irrigation was used on a large scale on the Ghagar and
is still practised on its upper reaches. Lower down earthen <i>bands</i> have
been superceded by a masonry weir at Otu in the Hiss&aacute;r district. The
northern and southern Ghagar canals, which irrigate lands in Hiss&aacute;r and
Bikaner, take off from this weir.</p>

<p><b>Action of Torrents.</b>&mdash;The Ghagar is large enough to exhibit all the three
stages which a <i>cho</i> or torrent of intermittent flow passes through.
Such a stream begins in the hills with a well-defined boulder-strewn
bed, which is never dry. Reaching the plains the bed of a cho becomes a
wide expanse of white sand, hardly below the level of the adjoining
country, with a thread of water passing down it in the cold weather. But
from time to time in the rainy season the channel is full from bank to
bank and the waters spill far and wide over the fields. Sudden spates
sometimes sweep away men and cattle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> before they can get across. If, as
in Hoshy&aacute;rpur, the <i>chos</i> flow into a rich plain from hills composed of
friable sandstone and largely denuded of tree-growth, they are in their
second stage most destructive. After long delay an Act was passed in
1900, which gives the government large powers for the protection of
trees in the Siw&aacute;liks and the reclamation of torrent beds in the plains.
The process of recovery cannot be rapid, but a measure of success has
already been attained. It must not be supposed that the action of <i>chos</i>
in this second stage is uniformly bad. Some carry silt as well as sand,
and the very light loam which the great M&aacute;rkanda <i>cho</i> has spread over
the country on its banks is worth much more to the farmer than the stiff
clay it has overlaid. Many <i>chos</i> do not pass into the third stage, when
all the sand has been dropped, and the bed shrinks into a narrow
ditch-like channel with steep clay banks. The inundations of torrents
like the Degh and the Ghagar after this stage is reached convert the
soil into a stiff impervious clay, where flood-water will lie for weeks
without being absorbed into the soil. In Karn&aacute;l the wretched and
fever-stricken tract between the Ghagar and the Sarust&iacute; known as the
Nail&iacute; is of this character.</p>

<p><b>The Jamna.</b>&mdash;The Jamna is the Yamuna of Sanskrit writers. Ptolemy's and
Pliny's versions, Diamouna and Jomanes, do not deviate much from the
original. It rises in the Kum&aacute;on Him&aacute;laya, and, where it first meets the
frontier of the Simla Hill States, receives from the north a large
tributary called the Tons. Henceforth, speaking broadly, the Jamna is
the boundary of the Panj&aacute;b and the United Provinces. On the Panj&aacute;b bank
are from north to south the Sirm&uacute;r State, Amb&aacute;la, Karn&aacute;l, Rohtak, Delhi,
and Gurg&aacute;on. The river leaves the Panj&aacute;b where Gurg&aacute;on and the district
of Mathra, which belongs to the United Provinces, meet, and finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
falls into the Ganges at Allah&aacute;b&aacute;d. North of Mathra Delhi is the only
important town on its banks. The Jamna is crossed by railway bridges
between Delhi and Meerut and between Amb&aacute;la and Sah&aacute;ranpur.</p>

<p><b>Changes in Rivers.</b>&mdash;Allusion has already been made to the changes which
the courses of Panj&aacute;b rivers are subject to in the plains. The Indus
below K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh once ran through the heart of what is now the Thal
desert. We know that in 1245 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Mult&aacute;n was in the Sind S&aacute;gar Do&aacute;b
between the Indus and the united streams of the Jhelam, Chen&aacute;b, and
R&aacute;v&iacute;. The Bi&aacute;s had then no connection with the Sutlej, but ran in a bed
of its own easily to be traced to-day in the Montgomery and Mult&aacute;n
districts, and joined the Indus between Mult&aacute;n and Uch. The Sutlej was
still flowing in the Hakra bed. Indeed its junction with the Bi&aacute;s near
Harike, which probably led to a complete change in the course of the
Bi&aacute;s, seems only to have taken place within the last 150 years<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h3>GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES</h3>


<p><b>Extent of Geological Record.</b>&mdash;Although the main part of the Panj&aacute;b plain
is covered by a mantle of comparatively recent alluvium, the provinces
described in this book display a more complete record of Indian
geological history than any other similar area in the country. The
variety is so great that no systematic or sufficient description could
be attempted in a short chapter, and it is not possible, therefore, to
do more in these few pages than give brief sketches of the patches of
unusual interest.</p>

<p><b>Aravall&iacute; System.</b>&mdash;In the southern and south-eastern districts of the
Panj&aacute;b there are exposures of highly folded and metamorphosed rocks
which belong to the most ancient formations in India. These occupy the
northern end of the Aravall&iacute; hills, which form but a relic of what must
have been at one time a great mountain range, stretching roughly
south-south-west through R&aacute;jput&aacute;na into the Bombay Presidency. The
northern ribs of the Aravall&iacute; series disappear beneath alluvial cover in
the Delhi district, but the rocks still underlie the plains to the west
and north-west, their presence being revealed by the small promontories
that peep through the alluvium near the Chen&aacute;b river, standing up as
small hills near Chiniot in the Sh&aacute;hpur, Jhang, and Lyallpur districts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The Salt Range in the Jhelam and Sh&aacute;hpur districts, with a western
continuation in the Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; district to and beyond the Indus, is the
most interesting part of the Panj&aacute;b to the geologist. It contains
notable records of three distinct eras in geological history. In
association with the well-known beds of rock-salt, which are being
extensively mined at Kheora, occur the most ancient fossiliferous
formations known in India, corresponding in age with the middle and
lower part of the Cambrian system of Europe. These very ancient strata
immediately overlie the red marls and associated rock-salt beds, and it
is possible that they have been thrust over bodily to occupy this
position, as we have no parallel elsewhere for the occurrence of great
masses of salt in formation older than the Cambrian.</p>

<p>The second fragment of geological history preserved in the Salt Range is
very much younger, beginning with rocks which were formed in the later
part of the Carboniferous period. The most remarkable feature in this
fragment is a boulder-bed, resting unconformably on the Cambrian strata
and including boulders of various shapes and sizes, which are often
faceted and striated in a way indicative of glacial action. Several of
the boulders belong to rocks of a peculiar and unmistakable character,
such as are found <i>in situ</i> on the western flanks of the Aravall&iacute; Range,
some 750 miles to the south. The glacial conditions which gave rise to
these boulder-beds were presumably contemporaneous with those that
produced the somewhat similar formation lying at the base of the great
coal-bearing system in the Indian peninsula. The glacial boulder-bed
thus offers indirect evidence as to the age of the Indian coal-measures,
for immediately above this bed in the Salt Range there occur sandstones
containing fossils which have affinities with the Upper Carboniferous
formations of Australia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> and on these sandstones again there lie
alternations of shales and limestones containing an abundance of fossils
that are characteristic of the Permo-Carboniferous rocks of Russia.
These are succeeded by an apparently conformable succession of beds of
still younger age, culminating in a series of shales, sandstones, and
limestones of unmistakably Triassic age.</p>

<p>There is then an interruption in the record, and the next younger series
preserved occurs in the western part of the Salt Range as well as in the
hills beyond the Indus. This formation is of Upper Jurassic age,
corresponding to the well-known beds of marine origin preserved in
Cutch. Then follows again a gap in the record, and the next most
interesting series of formations found in the Salt Range become of great
importance from the economic as well as from the purely scientific point
of view; these are the formations of Tertiary age.</p>

<p>The oldest of the Tertiary strata include a prominent limestone
containing Nummulitic fossils, which are characteristic of these Lower
Tertiary beds throughout the world. Here, as in many parts of
North-Western India, the Nummulitic limestones are associated with coal
which has been largely worked. The country between the Salt Range
plateau and the hilly region away to the north is covered by a great
stretch of comparatively young Tertiary formations, which were laid down
in fresh water after the sea had been driven back finally from this
region. The incoming of fresh-water conditions was inaugurated by the
formation of beds which are regarded as equivalent in age to those known
as the Upper Nari in Sind and Eastern Baluchist&aacute;n, but the still later
deposits, belonging to the well-known Siw&aacute;lik series, are famous on
account of the great variety and large size of many of the vertebrate
fossil remains which they have yielded. In these beds to the north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> of
the Salt Range there have been found remains of Dinotherium, forms
related to the ancestors of the giraffe and various other mammals, some
of them, like the Sivatherium, Mastodon, and Stegodon, being animals of
great size. On the northern side of the Salt Range three fairly
well-defined divisions of the Siw&aacute;lik series have been recognised, each
being conspicuously fossiliferous&mdash;a feature that is comparatively rare
in the Siw&aacute;lik hills further to the south-east, where these rocks were
first studied. The Siw&aacute;lik series of the Salt Range are thus so well
developed that this area might be conveniently regarded as the type
succession for the purpose of correlating isolated fragmentary
occurrences of the same general series in northern and western India. To
give an idea as to the age of these rocks, it will be sufficient to
mention that the middle division of the series corresponds roughly to
the well-known deposits of Pikermi and Samos.</p>

<p><b>Kashmir</b> deserves special mention, as it is a veritable paradise for the
geologist. Of the variety of problems that it presents one might mention
the petrological questions connected with the intrusion of the great
masses of granite, and their relation to the slates and associated
metamorphic rocks. Of fossiliferous systems there is a fine display of
material ranging in age from Silurian to Upper Trias, and additional
interest is added by the long-continued volcanic eruptions of the
"Panj&aacute;l trap." Students of recent phenomena have at their disposal
interesting problems in physiography, including a grand display of
glaciers, and the extensive deposits of so-called <i>karewas</i>, which
appear to have been formed in drowned valleys, where the normal
fluviatile conditions are modified by those characteristic of lakes. The
occurrence of sapphires in Z&aacute;nskar gives the State also an interest to
the mineralogist and connoisseur of gem-stones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this kaleidoscopic assemblage of questions the ones of most immediate
interest are connected with the Silurian-Trias succession in the Kashm&iacute;r
valley, for here we have a connecting-link between the marine formations
of the Salt Range area and those which are preserved in greater
perfection in Spit&iacute; and other parts of the Tibetan highlands, stretching
away to the south-east at the back of the great range of crystalline
snow-covered peaks.</p>

<p>In this interesting part of Kashm&iacute;r the most important feature to Indian
geologists is the occurrence of plant remains belonging to genera
identical with those that occur in the lower part of the great
coal-bearing formation of Peninsular India, known as the Gondw&aacute;na
system. Until these discoveries were made in Kashm&iacute;r about ten years ago
the age of the base of the Gondw&aacute;nas was estimated only on indirect
evidence, partly due to the assumption that glacial conditions in the
Salt Range and those at the base of the Gondw&aacute;nas were contemporaneous,
and partly due to analogy with the coal measures of Australia and South
Africa. In Kashm&iacute;r the characteristic plant remains of the Lower
Gondw&aacute;nas are found associated with marine fossils in great abundance,
and these permit of a correlation of the strata with the upper part of
the Carboniferous system of the European standard stratigraphical scale.</p>

<p>Kashm&iacute;r seems to have been near the estuary of one of the great rivers
that formerly flowed over the ancient continent of <i>Gondw&aacute;naland</i> (when
India and South Africa formed parts of one continental mass) into the
great Eurasian Ocean known as <i>Tethys</i>. As the deposits formed in this
great ocean give us the principal part of our data for forming a
standard stratigraphical scale, the plants which were carried out to sea
become witnesses of the kind of flora that flourished during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> main
Indian coal period; they thus enable us with great precision to fix the
position of the fresh-water Gondw&aacute;nas in comparison with the marine
succession.</p>

<p><b>Spit&iacute;.</b>&mdash;With &aacute; brief reference to one more interesting patch among the
geological records of this remarkable region, space will force us to
pass on to consideration of minerals of economic value. The line of
snow-covered peaks, composed mainly of crystalline rocks and forming a
core to the Him&aacute;laya in a way analogous to the granitic core of the
Alps, occupies what was once apparently the northern shore of
Gondw&aacute;naland, and to the north of it there stretched the great ocean of
Tethys, covering the central parts of Asia and Europe, one of its
shrunken relics being the present Mediterranean Sea. The bed of this
ocean throughout many geological ages underwent gradual depression and
received the sediments brought down by the rivers from the continent
which stretched away to the south. The sedimentary deposits thus formed
near the shore-line or further out in deep water attained a thickness of
well over 20,000 feet, and have been studied in the <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> of Spit&iacute;,
on the northern border of Kum&aacute;on, and again on the eastern Tibetan
plateau to the north of Darjeeling. A reference to the formations
preserved in Spit&iacute; may be regarded as typical of the geological history
and the conditions under which these formations were produced.</p>

<p><b>Succession of Fossiliferous Beds.</b>&mdash;In age the fossiliferous beds range
from Cambrian right through to the Tertiary epoch; between these
extremes no single period was passed without leaving its records in some
part of the great east-to-west Tibetan basin. At the base of the whole
succession there lies a series of schists which have been largely
metamorphosed, and on these rest the oldest of the fossiliferous series,
which, on account of their occurring in the region of snow, has been
named the <i>Haimanta system</i>. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> upper part of the Haimanta system has
been found to contain the characteristic trilobites of the Cambrian
period of Europe. Over this system lie beds which have yielded in
succession Ordovician and Silurian fossils, forming altogether a compact
division which has been distinguished locally as the <i>Muth system</i>. Then
follows the so-called <i>Kan&aacute;war system</i>, which introduces Devonian
conditions, followed by fossils characteristic of the well-known
mountain limestone of Europe.</p>

<p>Then occurs a break in the succession which varies in magnitude in
different localities, but appears to correspond to great changes in the
physical geography which widely affect the Indian region. This break
corresponds roughly to the upper part of the Carboniferous system of
Europe, and has been suggested as a datum line for distinguishing in
India an older group of fossiliferous systems below (formed in an area
that has been distinguished by the name <i>Dravidian</i>), from the younger
group above, which has been distinguished by the name <i>Aryan</i>.</p>

<p>During the periods that followed this interruption the bed of the great
Eurasian Ocean seems to have subsided persistently though
intermittently. As the various sediments accumulated the exact position
of the shore-line must have changed to some extent to give rise to the
conditions favourable for the formation at one time of limestone, at
another of shale and at other times of sandy deposits. The whole column
of beds, however, seems to have gone on accumulating without any folding
movements, and they are consequently now found lying apparently in
perfect conformity stage upon stage, from those that are Permian in age
at the base, right through the Mesozoic group, till the time when
Tertiary conditions were inaugurated and the earth movements began which
ultimately drove back the ocean and raised the bed, with its accumulated
load<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> of sediments, into the great folds that now form the Him&aacute;layan
Range. This great mass of Aryan strata includes an enormous number of
fossil remains, giving probably a more complete record of the gradual
changes that came over the marine fauna of Tethys than any other area of
the kind known. One must pass over the great number of interesting
features still left unmentioned, including the grand architecture of the
Sub-Him&aacute;laya and the diversity of formations in different parts of the
Frontier Province; for the rest of the available space must be devoted
to a brief reference to the minerals of value.</p>

<p><b>Rock-salt</b>, which occurs in abundance, is possibly the most important
mineral in this area. The deposits most largely worked are those which
occur in the well-known Salt Range, covering parts of the districts of
Jhelam, Sh&aacute;hpur, and Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;. Near the village of Kheora the main seam,
which is being worked in the Mayo mines, has an aggregate thickness of
550 feet, of which five seams, with a total thickness of 275 feet,
consist of salt pure enough to be placed on the table with no more
preparation than mere pulverising. The associated beds are impregnated
with earth, and in places there occur thin layers of potash and
magnesian salts. In this area salt quarrying was practised for an
unknown period before the time of Akbar, and was continued in a
primitive fashion until it came under the control of the British
Government with the occupation of the Panj&aacute;b in 1849. In 1872 systematic
mining operations were planned, and the general line of work has been
continued ever since, with an annual output of roughly 100,000 tons.</p>

<p>Open quarries for salt are developed a short distance to the
east-north-east of K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh on the Indus, and similar open work is
practised near Koh&aacute;t in the North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> West Frontier Province, where the
quantity of salt may be regarded as practically inexhaustible. At
Bah&aacute;dur Khel the salt lies at the base of the Tertiary series, and can
be traced for a distance of about eight miles with an exposed thickness
of over 1000 feet, sometimes standing up as hills of solid salt above
the general level of the plains. In this area the production is
naturally limited by want of transport and the small local demand, the
total output from the quarries being about 16,000 tons per annum. A
small quantity of salt (generally about 4000 tons a year), is raised
also from open quarries in the Mand&iacute; State, where the rock-salt beds,
distinctly impure and earthy, lie near the junction between Tertiary
formations and the older unfossiliferous groups.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b> occurs at numerous places in association with the Nummulitic
limestones of Lower Tertiary age, in the Panj&aacute;b, in the North West
Frontier Province, and in the Jammu division of Kashm&iacute;r. The largest
output has been obtained from the Salt Range, where mines have been
opened up on behalf of the North Western Railway. The mines at Dandot in
the Jhelam district have considerable fluctuations in output, which,
however, for many years ranged near 50,000 tons. These mines, having
been worked at a financial loss, were finally abandoned by the Railway
Company in 1911, but a certain amount of work is still being continued
by local contractors. At Bh&aacute;ganw&aacute;la, 19 miles further east, in the
adjoining district of Sh&aacute;hpur, coal was also worked for many years for
the North Western State Railway, but the maximum output in any one year
never exceeded 14,000 tons, and in 1900, owing to the poor quality of
material obtained, the collieries were closed down. Recently, small
outcrop workings have been developed in the same formation further west
on the southern scarp of the Salt Range at Tejuw&aacute;la in the Sh&aacute;hpur
district.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Gold</b> to a small amount is washed from the gravel of the Indus and some
other rivers by native workers, and large concessions have been granted
for systematic dredging, but these enterprises have not yet reached the
commercially paying stage.</p>

<p><b>Other Metals.</b>&mdash;Prospecting has been carried on at irregular intervals in
Kulu and along the corresponding belt of schistose rocks further west in
Kashm&iacute;r and Chitr&aacute;l. The copper ores occur as sulphides along certain
bands in the chloritic and micaceous schists, similar in composition and
probably in age to those worked further east in Kum&aacute;on, in Nip&aacute;l, and in
Sikkim. In Lahul near the Shigr&iacute; glacier there is a lode containing
<b>antimony</b> sulphide with ores of <b>zinc</b> and <b>lead</b>, which would almost
certainly be opened up and developed but for the difficulty of access
and cost of transport to the only valuable markets.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> springs occur among the Tertiary formations of the Panj&aacute;b and
Biluchist&aacute;n, and a few thousand gallons of oil are raised annually.
Prospecting operations have been carried on vigorously during the past
two or three years, but no large supplies have so far been proved. The
principal oil-supplies of Burma and Assam have been obtained from rocks
of Miocene age, like those of Persia and the Caspian region, but the
most promising "shows" in North West India have been in the older
Nummulitic formations, and the oil is thus regarded by some experts as
the residue of the material which has migrated from the Miocene beds
that probably at one time covered the Nummulitic formations, but have
since been removed by the erosive action of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>Alum</b> is manufactured from the pyritous shales of the Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; district,
the annual output being generally about 200 to 300 tons. Similar shales
containing pyrites are known to occur in other parts of this area, and
possibly the industry might be considerably extended, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> annual
requirements of India, judged by the import returns, exceed ten times
the native production of alum.</p>

<p><b>Borax</b> is produced in Lad&aacute;kh and larger quantities are imported across
the frontier from Tibet. In the early summer one frequently meets herds
of sheep being driven southwards across the Himalayan passes, each sheep
carrying a couple of small saddle-bags laden with borax or salt, which
is bartered in the Panj&aacute;b bazars for Indian and foreign stores for the
winter requirements of the snow-blocked valleys beyond the frontier.</p>

<p><b>Sapphires.</b>&mdash;The sapphires of Z&aacute;nskar have been worked at intervals since
the discovery of the deposit in 1881, and some of the finest stones in
the gem market have been obtained from this locality, where work is,
however, difficult on account of the great altitude and the difficulty
of access from the plains.</p>

<p><b>Limestone.</b>&mdash;Large deposits of Nummulitic limestone are found in the
older Tertiary formations of North-West India. It yields a pure lime and
is used in large quantities for building purposes. The constant
association of these limestones with shale beds, and their frequent
association with coal, naturally suggest their employment for the
manufacture of cement; and special concessions have recently been given
by the Panj&aacute;b Government with a view of encouraging the development of
the industry. The nodular impure limestone, known generally by the name
of <i>kankar</i>, contains sufficient clay to give it hydraulic characters
when burnt, and much cement is thus manufactured. The varying
composition of <i>kankar</i> naturally results in a product of irregular
character, and consequently cement so made can replace Portland cement
only for certain purposes.</p>

<p><b>Slate</b> is quarried in various places for purely local use. In the K&aacute;ngra
valley material of very high quality is obtained and consequently
secures a wide distribution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> limited, however, by competition with
cheaply made tiles.</p>

<p><b>Gypsum</b> occurs in large quantities in association with the rock-salt of
the Salt Range, but the local demand is small. There are also beds of
potash and magnesian salts in the same area, but their value and
quantity have not been thoroughly proved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h3>CLIMATE</h3>


<p><b>Types of Climate.</b>&mdash;The climate of the Panj&aacute;b plains is determined by
their distance from the sea and the existence of formidable mountain
barriers to the north and west. The factor of elevation makes the
climate of the Himalayan tracts very different from that of the plains.
Still more striking is the contrast between the Indian Himalayan climate
and the Central Asian Trans-Himalayan climate of Spit&iacute;, Lahul, and
Lad&aacute;kh.</p>

<p><b>Zones.</b>&mdash;A broad division into six zones may be recognised:</p>



<div class='centered'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="60%" cellspacing="0" summary="A broad division into six zones">

</table></div>


<p><b>Trans-Himalayan Climate.</b>&mdash;Spit&iacute;, Lahul, and Lad&aacute;kh are outside the
meteorological influences which affect the rest of the Indian Empire.
The lofty ranges of the Him&aacute;laya interpose an almost insurmountable
barrier between them and the clouds of the monsoon. The rainfall is
extraordinarily small, and, considering the elevation of the inhabited
parts, 10,000 to 14,000 feet, the snowfall there is not heavy. The air
is intensely dry and clear, and the daily and seasonal range of
temperature is extreme. Leh, the capital of Lad&aacute;kh (11,500 feet), has an
average<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> rainfall (including snow) of about 3 inches. The mean
temperature is 43&deg; Fahr., varying from 19&deg; in January to 64&deg; in July.
But these figures give no idea of the rigours of the severe but healthy
climate. The daily range is from 25 to 30 degrees, or double what we are
accustomed to in England. Once 17&deg; below zero was recorded. In the rare
dry clear atmosphere the power of the solar rays is extraordinary.
"Rocks exposed to the sun may be too hot to lay the hand upon at the
same time that it is freezing in the shade."</p>

<p><b>The Indian Zones&mdash;Meteorological factors.</b>&mdash;The distribution of pressure
in India, determined mainly by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> changes of temperature, and itself
determining the direction of the winds and the character of the weather,
is shown graphically in figures 17 and 18. The winter or north-east
monsoon does not penetrate into the Panj&aacute;b, where light westernly and
northernly winds prevail during the cold season. What rain is received
is due to land storms originating beyond the western frontier. The
branch of the summer or south-west monsoon which chiefly affects the
Panj&aacute;b is that which blows up the Bay of Bengal. The rain-clouds
striking the Eastern Him&aacute;laya are deflected to the west and forced up
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> Gangetic plain by south-westernly winds. The lower ranges of the
Panj&aacute;b Him&aacute;laya receive in this way very heavy downpours. The rain
extends into the plains, but exhausts itself and dies away pretty
rapidly to the south and west. The Bombay branch of the monsoon mostly
spends itself on the Gh&aacute;ts and in the Deccan. But a part of it
penetrates from time to time to the south-east Panj&aacute;b, and, if it is
sucked into the Bay current, the result is widespread rain.</p>

<p><b>Himalayan Zone.</b>&mdash;The impressions which English people get of the climate
of the Him&aacute;laya, or in Indian phrase "the Hills," are derived mainly
from stations like Simla and Murree perched at a height of from 6500 to
7500 feet on the outer ranges. The data of meteorologists are mainly
taken from the same localities. Places between 8000 and 10,000 feet in
height and further from the plains enjoy a finer climate, being both
cooler and drier in summer. But they are less accessible, and weakly
persons would find the greater rarity of the air trying.</p>

<p>In the first fortnight of April the plains become disagreeably warm, and
it is well to take European children to the Hills. The Panj&aacute;b Government
moves to Simla in the first fortnight of May. By that time Simla is
pretty warm in the middle of the day, but the nights are pleasant. The
mean temperature of the 24 hours in May and June is 65&deg; or 66&deg;, the mean
maximum and minimum being 78&deg; and 59&deg;. Thunderstorms with or without
hail are not uncommon in April, May, and June. In a normal year the
monsoon clouds drift up in the end of June, and the next three months
are "the Rains." Usually it does not rain either all day or every day;
but sometimes for weeks together Simla is smothered in a blanket of grey
mist. Normally the rain comes in bursts with longer or shorter breaks
between. About<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> the third week of September the rains often cease quite
suddenly, the end being usually proclaimed by a thunderstorm. Next
morning one wakes to a new heaven and a new earth, a perfectly cloudless
sky, and clean, crisp, cool air. This ideal weather lasts for the next
three months. Even in December the days are made pleasant by bright
sunshine, and the range of temperature is much less than in the plains.
In the end of December or beginning of January the night thermometer
often falls lower at Amb&aacute;la and R&aacute;walpind&iacute; than at Simla and Murree.
After Christmas the weather becomes broken, and in January and February
falls of snow occur. It is a disagreeable time, and English residents
are glad to descend to the plains. In March also the weather is often
unsettled. The really heavy falls of snow occur at levels much higher
than Simla. These remarks apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to Dharms&aacute;la,
Dalhousie, and Murree. Owing to its position right under a lofty
mountain wall Dharms&aacute;la is a far wetter place than Simla. Murree gets
its monsoon later, and the summer rainfall is a good deal lighter. In
winter it has more snow, being nearer the source of origin of the
storms. Himalayan valleys at an elevation of 5000 feet, such as the Vale
of Kashm&iacute;r, have a pleasant climate. The mean temperature of Sr&iacute;nagar
(5255 feet) varies from 33&deg; in January to 75&deg; in July, when it is
unpleasantly hot, and Europeans often move to Gulmarg. Kashm&iacute;r has a
heavy snowfall even in the Jhelam valley. Below 4000 feet, especially in
confined river valleys the Himalayan climate is often disagreeably hot
and stuffy.</p>

<p><b>Climate of the Plains.</b>&mdash;The course of the seasons is the same in the
plains. The jaded resident finds relief when the rains cease in the end
of September. The days are still warm, but the skies are clear, the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
dry, and the nights cool. November is rainless and in every way a
pleasant month. The clouds begin to gather before Christmas, but rain
often holds off till January. Pleasant though the early months of the
cold weather are, they lay traps for the unwary. In October and November
the daily range of temperature is very large, exceeding 30&deg;, and the
fall at sunset very sudden. Care is needed to avoid a chill and the
fever that follows. Clear and dry though the air is, the blue of the
skies is pale owing to a light dust haze in the upper atmosphere. For
the same reason the Himalayan snows except after rain are veiled from
dwellers in the plains at a distance of 30 miles from the foot-hills.
The air in these months before the winter rains is wonderfully still. In
the three months after Christmas the Panj&aacute;b is the pathway of a series
of small storms from the west, preceded by close weather and occurring
usually at intervals of a few weeks. After a day or two of wet weather
the sky clears, and the storm is followed by a great drop in the
temperature. The traveller who shivers after a January rain-storm finds
it hard to believe that the Panj&aacute;b plain is a part of the hottest region
of the Old World which stretches from the Sah&aacute;ra to Delhi. If he had to
spend the period from May to July there he would have small doubts on
the subject. The heat begins to be unpleasant in April, when hot
westernly winds prevail. An occasional thunderstorm with hail relieves
the strain for a little. The warmest period of the year is May and June.
But the intense dry heat is healthier and to many less trying than the
mugginess of the rainy season. The dust-storms which used to be common
have become rarer and lighter with the spread of canal irrigation in the
western Panj&aacute;b. The rains ought to break at Delhi in the end of June and
at Lahore ten days or a fortnight later. There is often a long break
when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> the climate is particularly trying. The nights are terribly hot.
The outer air is then less stifling than that of the house, and there is
the chance of a little comparative coolness shortly before dawn. Many
therefore prefer to sleep on the roof or in the verandah. September,
when the rains slacken, is a muggy, unpleasant, and unhealthy month. But
in the latter half of it cooler nights give promise of a better time.</p>

<p><b>Special features of Plain Zones.</b>&mdash;The submontane zone has the most
equable and the pleasantest climate in the plains. It has a rainfall of
from 30 to 40 inches, five-sevenths or more of which belongs to the
monsoon period (June-September). The north-western area has a longer and
colder winter and spring. In the end of December and in January the keen
dry cold is distinctly trying. The figures in Statement I, for
R&aacute;walpind&iacute; and Pesh&aacute;war, are not very characteristic of the zone as a
whole. The average of the rainfall figures, 13 inches for Pesh&aacute;war and
32 for R&aacute;walpind&iacute;, would give a truer result. The monsoon rains come
later and are much less abundant than in the submontane zone. Their
influence is very feeble in the western and south-western part of the
area. On the other hand the winter rains, are heavier than in any other
part of the province. Delhi and Lahore represent the extreme conditions
of the central and south-eastern plains. The latter is really on the
edge of the dry south-western area. The eastern districts of the zone
have a shorter and less severe cold weather than the western, an earlier
and heavier monsoon, but scantier winter rains. The total rainfall
varies from 16 to 30 inches. The south-western zone, with a rainfall of
from 5 to 15 inches, is the driest part of India proper except northern
Sindh and western R&aacute;jput&aacute;na. Neither monsoon current affects it much. At
Mult&aacute;n there are only about fifteen days in the whole year on which any
rain falls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<h3>HERBS, SHRUBS, AND TREES</h3>


<p><b>Affinities of Panj&aacute;b Flora.</b>&mdash;It is hopeless to describe except in the
broadest outline the flora of a tract covering an area of 250,000 square
miles and ranging in altitude from a few hundred feet to a height 10,000
feet above the limit of flowering plants. The nature of the vegetation
of any tract depends on rainfall and temperature, and only secondarily
on soil. A desert is a tract with a dry substratum and dry air, great
heat during some part of the year, and bright sunshine. The soil may be
loam or sand, and as regards vegetation a sandy desert is the worst
owing to the rapid drying up of the subsoil after rain. In the third of
the maps appended to Schimper's <i>Plant Geography</i> by far the greater
part of the area dealt with in this book is shown as part of the vast
desert extending from the Sah&aacute;ra to Manchuria. Seeing that the monsoon
penetrates into the province and that it is traversed by large snow-fed
rivers the Panj&aacute;b, except in parts of the extreme western and
south-western districts, is not a desert like the Sah&aacute;ra or Gob&iacute;, and
Schimper recognised this by marking most of the area as semi-desert.
Still the flora outside the Hills and the submontane tract is
predominantly of the desert type, being xerophilous or
drought-resisting. The adaptations which enable plants to survive in a
tract deficient in moisture are of various kinds. The roots may be
greatly developed to enable them to tap the subsoil moisture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> the
leaves may be reduced in size, converted into thorns, or entirely
dispensed with, in order to check rapid evaporation, they may be covered
with silky or felted hairs, a modification which produces the same
result, or their internal tissue may be succulent or mucilaginous. In
the plants of the Panj&aacute;b plains there is no difficulty in recognising
these features of a drought-resisting flora. Schimper's map shows in the
north-east of the area a wedge thrust in between the plains' desert and
the dry elevated alpine desert cut off from the influence of the monsoon
by the lofty barrier of the Inner Him&aacute;laya. This consists of two parts,
monsoon forest, corresponding roughly with the Himalayan area Cis R&aacute;v&iacute;
above the 5000 feet contour, and dry woodland of a semi-tropical stamp,
consisting, of the adjoining foot-hills and submontane tract. This wedge
is in fact treated as part of the zone, which in the map (after Drude)
prefixed to Willis' <i>Manual and Dictionary of the Flowering Plants and
Ferns</i>, is called Indo-Malayan, and which embraces the Malayan
Archipelago and part of North Australia, Burma, and practically the
whole of India except the Panj&aacute;b, Sindh, and R&aacute;jput&aacute;na. In Drude's map
the three countries last mentioned are included in a large zone called
"the Mediterranean and Orient." This is a very broad classification, and
in tracing the relationships of the Panj&aacute;b flora it is better to treat
the desert area of North Africa, which in Tripoli and Egypt extends to
the coast, apart from the Mediterranean zone. It is a familiar fact
that, as we ascend lofty mountains like those of the Him&aacute;laya, we pass
through belts or regions of vegetation of different types. The air
steadily becomes rarer and therefore colder, especially at night, and at
the higher levels there is a marked reduction in the rainfall. When the
alpine region, which in the Him&aacute;laya may be taken as beginning at 11,000
feet, is reached,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> the plants have as a rule bigger roots, shorter
stems, smaller leaves, but often larger and more brilliantly coloured
flowers. These are adaptations of a drought-resisting kind.</p>

<p><b>Regions.</b>&mdash;In this sketch it will suffice to divide the tract into six
regions:</p>



<div class='centered'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="65%" summary="Regions.">

</table></div>


<p>Of course a flora does not fit itself into compartments, and the changes
of type are gradual.</p>

<p><b>Panj&aacute;b Dry Plain.</b>&mdash;The affinities of the flora of the Panj&aacute;b plains
south of the Salt Range and the submontane tract are, especially in the
west, with the desert areas of Persia, Arabia, and North Africa, though
the spread of canal irrigation is modifying somewhat the character of
the vegetation. The soil and climate are unsuited to the growth of large
trees, but adapted to scrub jungle of a drought-resisting type, which at
one time covered very large areas from the Jamna to the Jhelam. The soil
on which this sparse scrub grew is a good strong loam, but the rainfall
was too scanty and the water-level too deep to admit of much cultivation
outside the valleys of the rivers till the labours of canal engineers
carried their waters to the uplands. East of the Sutlej the Bikaner
desert thrusts northwards a great wedge of sandy land which occupies a
large area in Bah&aacute;walpur, Hiss&aacute;r, Ferozepur, and Pati&aacute;la. Soil of this
description is free of forest growth, and the monsoon rainfall in this
part of the province is sufficient to encourage an easy, but very
precarious, cultivation of autumn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> millets and pulses. The great Thal
desert to the south of the Salt Range between the valleys of the Jhelam
and the Indus has a similar soil, but the scantiness of the rainfall has
confined cultivation within much narrower limits. Between the Sutlej and
the Jhelam the uplands between the river valleys are known locally as
B&aacute;rs. The largest of the truly indigenous trees of the Panj&aacute;b plains are
the <i>far&aacute;sh</i> (Tamarix articulata) and the thorny <i>k&iacute;kar</i> (Acacia
Arabica). The latter yields excellent wood for agricultural implements,
and fortunately it grows well in sour soils. Smaller thorny acacias are
the <i>n&iacute;mbar</i> or <i>raunj</i> (Acacia leucophloea) and the <i>khair</i> (Acacia
Senegal). The dwarf tamarisk, <i>pilch&iacute;</i> or <i>jhao</i> (Tamarix dioica), grows
freely in moist sandy soils near rivers. The scrub jungle consists
mostly of <i>jand</i> (Prosopis spicigera), a near relation of the Acacias,
<i>j&aacute;l</i> or <i>van</i> (Salvadora oleoides), and the coral-flowered <i>kar&iacute;l</i> or
leafless caper (Capparis aphylla). All these show their desert
affinities, the <i>jand</i> by its long root and its thorns, the <i>j&aacute;l</i> by its
small leathery leaves, and the <i>kar&iacute;l</i> by the fact that it has managed
to dispense with leaves altogether. The <i>jand</i> is a useful little tree,
and wherever it grows the natural qualities of the soil are good. The
sweetish fruit of the <i>j&aacute;l</i>, known as <i>p&iacute;lu</i>, is liked by the people,
and in famines they will even eat the berries of the leafless caper.
Other characteristic plants of the Panj&aacute;b plains are under Leguminosae,
the <i>khip</i> (Crotalaria burhia), two Farsetias (<i>far&iacute;d k&iacute; b&uacute;ti</i>), and the
<i>jaw&aacute;sa</i> or camel thorn (Alhagi camelorum), practically leafless, but
with very long and stout spines; under Capparidaceae several Cleomes,
species of Corchorus (Tiliaceae), under Zygophyllaceae three
Mediterranean genera, Tribulus, Zygophyllum, and Fagonia, under
Solanaceae several Solanums and Withanias, and various salsolaceous
Chenopods known as <i>l&aacute;na</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In the sandier tracts the <i>ak</i> (Calotropis procera, N.O.
Asclepiadaceae), the <i>harmal</i> (Peganum harmala, N.O. Rutaceae), and the
colocynth gourd (Citrullus colocynthis, N.O. Cucurbitaceae), which,
owing to the size of its roots, manages to flourish in the sands of
African and Indian deserts, grow abundantly. Common weeds of cultivation
are Fumaria parviflora, a near relation of the English fumitory, Silene
conoidea, and two Spergulas (Caryophyllaceae), and Sisymbrium Irio
(Cruciferae). A curious little Orchid, Zeuxine sulcata, is found growing
among the grass on canal banks. The American yellow poppy, Argemone
Mexicana, a noxious weed, has unfortunately established itself widely in
the Panj&aacute;b plain. Two trees of the order Leguminosae, the <i>shisham</i> or
<i>t&aacute;l&iacute;</i> (Dalbergia Sissoo) and the <i>siris</i> (Albizzia lebbek), are
commonly planted on Panj&aacute;b roads. The true home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> of the former is in
river beds in the low hills or in ravines below the hills. But it is a
favourite tree on roads and near wells throughout the province, and
deservedly so, for it yields excellent timber. The <i>siris</i> on the other
hand is an untidy useless tree. The <i>k&iacute;kar</i> might be planted as a
roadside tree to a greater extent. Several species of figs, especially
the <i>p&iacute;pal</i> (Ficus religiosa) and <i>bor</i> or banian (Ficus Indica) are
popular trees.</p>

<p><b>Salt Range and North-West Plains.</b>&mdash;-Our second region may be taken as
extending from the Pabb&iacute; hills on the east of the Jhelam in Gujr&aacute;t to
our administrative boundary beyond the Indus, its southern limit being
the Salt Range. Here the flora is of a distinctly Mediterranean type.
Poppies are as familiar in R&aacute;walpindi as they are in England or Italy,
and Hypecoum procumbens, a curious Italian plant of the same order, is
found in Attock. The abundance of Crucifers is also a Mediterranean
feature. Eruca sativa, the oil-seed known as <i>t&aacute;ram&iacute;ra</i> or <i>jami&aacute;n</i>,
which sows itself freely in waste land and may be found growing even on
railway tracks in the R&aacute;walpind&iacute; division, is an Italian and Spanish
weed. Malcolmia strigosa, which spreads a reddish carpet over the
ground, and Malcolmia Africana are common Crucifers near R&aacute;walpind&iacute;. The
latter is a Mediterranean species. The Salt Range genera Diplotaxis and
Moricandia are Italian, and the peculiar Notoceras Canariensis found in
Attock is also a native of the Canary Islands. Another order,
Boraginaceae, which is very prominent in the Mediterranean region, is
also important in the North-West Panj&aacute;b, though the showier plants of
the order are wanting. One curious Borage, Arnebia Griffithii, seems to
be purely Asiatic. It has five brown spots on its petals, which fade and
disappear in the noonday sunshine. These are supposed to be drops of
sweat which fell from Muhammad's forehead, hence the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> plant is called
<i>paighambar&iacute; ph&uacute;l</i> or the prophet's flower. Among Composites Calendulas
and Carthamus oxyacantha or the <i>pohl&iacute;</i>, a near relation of the
Carthamus which yields the saffron dye, are abundant. Both are common
Mediterranean genera. Silybum Marianum, a handsome thistle with large
leaves mottled with white, extends from Britain to R&aacute;walpind&iacute;.
Interesting species are Tulipa stellata and Tulipa chrysantha. The
latter is a Salt Range plant, as is the crocus-like Merendera Persica,
and the yellow Iris Aitchisoni. A curious plant found in the same hills
is the cactus-like Boucerosia (N.O. Asclepiadaceae), recalling to
botanists the more familiar Stapelias of the same order. Another
leafless Asclepiad, Periploca aphylla, which extends westwards to Arabia
and Nubia and southwards to Sindh, is, like Boucerosia, a typical
xerophyte adapted to a very dry soil and atmosphere. The thorny Acacias,
A. eburnea and A. modesta (vern. <i>phul&aacute;h&iacute;</i>), of the low bare hills of
the N.W. Panj&aacute;b are also drought-resisting plants.</p>

<p><b>Submontane Region.</b>&mdash;The Submontane region consists of a broad belt below
the Siw&aacute;liks extending from the Jamna nearly to the Jhelam, and may be
said to include the districts of Amb&aacute;la, Karn&aacute;l (part), Hoshy&aacute;rpur,
K&aacute;ngra (part), Haz&aacute;ra (part), Jalandhar, Gurd&aacute;spur, Si&aacute;lkot, Gujr&aacute;t
(part). In its flora there is a strong infusion of Indo-Malayan
elements. An interesting member of it is the Butea frondosa, a small
tree of the order Leguminosae. It is known by several names, <i>dh&aacute;k</i>,
<i>chichra</i>, <i>pal&aacute;h</i>, and <i>pal&aacute;s</i>. Putting out its large orange-red
flowers in April it ushers in the hot weather. It has a wide range from
Ceylon to Bengal, where it has given its name to the town of Dacca and
the battlefield of Plassy (Pal&aacute;si). From Bengal it extends all the way
to Haz&aacute;ra. There can be no doubt that a large part of the submontane
region was once <i>dh&aacute;k</i> forest. Tracts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> in the north of Karn&aacute;l&mdash;Chachra,
in Jalandhar&mdash;Dardh&aacute;k, and in Gujr&aacute;t&mdash;Pal&aacute;h&iacute;, have taken their names
from this tree. It coppices very freely, furnishes excellent firewood
and good timber for the wooden frames on which the masonry cylinders of
wells are reared, it exudes a valuable gum, its flowers yield a dye, and
the dry leaves are eaten by buffaloes. A tree commonly planted near
wells and villages in the submontane tract is the <i>dhrek</i> (Melia
azedarach, N.O. Meliaceae), which is found as far west as Persia and is
often called by English people the Persian lilac. The <i>bahera</i>
(Terminalia belerica, N.O. Combretaceae), a much larger tree, is
Indo-Malayan. Common shrubs are the <i>marwan</i> (Vitex negundo, N.O.
Verbenaceae), Plumbago Zeylanica (Plumbaginaceae), the <i>b&aacute;nsa</i> or
<i>bhekar</i> (Adhatoda vasica, N.O. Acanthaceae). The last is Indo-Malayan.
Among herbs Cassias, which do not occur in Europe, are common. The
curious cactus-like Euphorbia Royleana grows abundantly and is used for
making hedges.</p>

<p><b>Sub-Him&aacute;laya.</b>&mdash;A large part of the Sub-Himalayan region belongs to the
Siw&aacute;liks. The climate is fairly moist and subject to less extremes of
heat and cold than the regions described above. A strong infusion of
Indo-Malayan types is found and a noticeable feature is the large number
of flowering trees and shrubs. Such beautiful flowering trees as the
<i>simal</i> or silk-cotton tree (Bombax Malabaricum, N.O. Malvaceae), the
<i>amalt&aacute;s</i> (Cassia fistula), Albizzia mollis and Albizzia stipulata,
Erythrina suberosa, Bauhinia purpurea and Bauhinia variegata, all
belonging to the order Leguminosae, are unknown in Europe, but common in
the Indo-Malayan region. This is true also of Oroxylum Indicum (N.O.
Bignoniaceae) with its remarkable long sword-like capsules, and of the
<i>kam&iacute;la</i> (Mallotus Philippinensis), which abounds in the low hills, but
may escape the traveller's notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> as its flowers have no charm of form
or colour. He will in spring hardly fail to observe another Indo-Malayan
tree, the <i>dh&aacute;w&iacute;</i> (Woodfordia floribunda, N.O. Lythraceae) with its
bright red flowers. Shrubs with conspicuous flowers are also common,
among which may be noted species of Clematis, Capparis spinosa, Kydia
calycina, Mimosa rubicaulis, Hamiltonia suaveolens, Caryopteris
Wallichiana, and Nerium Oleander. The latter grows freely in sandy
torrent beds. Rhus cotinus, which reddens the hillsides in May, is a
native also of Syria, Italy, and Southern France. Other trees to be
noticed are a wild pear (Pyrus pashia), the olive (Olea cuspidata), the
<i>khair</i> (Acacia catechu) useful to tanners, the <i>tun</i> (Cedrela toona),
whose wood is often used for furniture, the <i>dh&aacute;man</i> (Grewia
oppositifolia, N.O. Tiliaceae), and several species of fig. The most
valuable products however of the forests of the lower hills are the
<i>ch&iacute;r</i> or <i>ch&iacute;l</i> pine (Pinus longifolia), and a giant grass, the bamboo
(Dendrocalamus strictus), which attains a height of from 20 to 40 feet.
Shrubs which grow freely on stony hills are the <i>sanattha</i> or <i>mendru</i>
(Dodonaea viscosa, N.O. Sapindaceae), which is a valuable protection
against denudation, as goats pass it by, the <i>garna</i>, which is a species
of Carissa, and Plectranthus rugosus. Climbers are common. The great
Hiptage madablota (N.O. Malpighiaceae), the Bauhinia Vahlii or elephant
creeper, and some species of the parasitic Loranthus, deserve mention,
also Acacia caesia, Pueraria tuberosa, Vallaris Heynei, Porana
paniculata, and several vines, especially Vitis lanata with its large
rusty leaves. Characteristic herbs are the sweet-scented Viola patrinii,
the slender milkwort; Polygala Abyssinica, a handsome pea, Vigna
vexillata, a borage, Trichodesma Indicum, a balsam, Impatiens balsamina,
familiar in English gardens, the beautiful delicate little blue
Evolvulus alsinoides, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> showy purple convolvulus, Ipomaea hederacea,
and a curious lily, Gloriosa superba.</p>

<p><b>Temperate Him&aacute;laya.</b>&mdash;The richest part of the temperate Himalayan flora
is probably in the 7500-10,000 zone. Above 10,000 feet sup-alpine
conditions begin, and at 12,000 feet tree growth becomes very scanty and
the flora is distinctly alpine. The <i>ch&iacute;r</i> pine so common in
sub-Himalayan forests extends up to 6500 feet. At this height and 1000
feet lower the <i>ban</i> oak (Quercus incana), grey on the lower side of the
leaf, which is so common at Simla, abounds. Where the <i>ch&iacute;l</i> stops, the
<i>kail</i> or blue pine (Pinus excelsa), after the <i>deod&aacute;r</i> the most
valuable product of Himalayan forests, begins. Its zone may be taken as
from 7000 to 9000 feet. To the same zone belong the <i>kelu</i> or <i>deod&aacute;r</i>
(Cedrus Libani), the glossy leaved <i>mohru</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> oak (Quercus dilatata),
whose wood is used for making charcoal, and two small trees of the Heath
order, Rhododendron arborea and Pieris ovalifolia. The former in April
and May lightens up with its bright red flowers the sombre Simla
forests. The <i>kharshu</i> or rusty-leaved oak (Quercus semecarpifolia)
affects a colder climate than its more beautiful glossy-leaved relation,
and may almost be considered sub-alpine. It is common on Hattu, and the
oaks there present a forlorn appearance after rain with funereal mosses
dripping with moisture hanging from their trunks. The firs, Picea
morinda, with its grey tassels, and Abies Pindrow with its dark green
yew-like foliage, succeed the blue pine. Picea may be said to range from
8000 to 10,000 feet, and the upper limit of Abies is from 1000 to 2000
feet higher. These splendid trees are unfortunately of small commercial
value. The yew, Taxus baccata, is found associated with them. Between
5000 and 8000 feet, besides the oaks and other broad-leaved trees
already noticed, two relations of the dogwood, Cornus capitata and
Cornus macrophylla, a large poplar, Populus ciliata, a pear, Pyrus
lanata, a holly, Ilex dipyrena, an elm and its near relation, Celtis
australis, and species of Rhus and Euonymus, may be mentioned. Cornus
capitata is a small tree, but it attracts notice because the heads of
flowers surrounded by bracts of a pale yellow colour have a curious
likeness to a rose, and the fruit is in semblance not unlike a
strawberry. Above 8000 feet several species of maple abound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
which has been introduced into English shrubberies. The great vine, The
<i>chin&aacute;r</i> or Platanus orientalis, found as far west as Sicily, grows to
splendid proportions by the quiet waterways of the Vale of Kashm&iacute;r. The
undergrowth in temperate Himalayan forests consists largely of

Vitis Himalayana, whose leaves turn red in autumn, climbs up many of the
trees. Of the flowers it is impossible to give any adequate account. The
flora is distinctly Mediterranean in type; the orders in Collett's
<i>Flora Simlensis</i> which are not represented in the Italian flora contain
hardly more than 5 per cent. of the total genera. The plants included in
some of these non-Mediterranean orders are very beautiful, for example,
the Begonias, the Amphicomes (Bignoniaceae), Chirita bifolia and
Platystemma violoides (Gesneraceae), and Hedychium (Scitamineae). More
important members of the flora are species of Clematis, including the
beautiful white Clematis montana, anemones, larkspurs, columbine,
monkshoods, St John's worts, geraniums, balsams, species of Astragalus,
Potentillas, Asters, ragworts, species of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> Cynoglossum, gentians and
Swertias, Androsaces and primroses, Wulfenia and louseworts, species of
Strobilanthes, Salvias and Nepetas, orchids, irises, Ophiopogon, Smilax,
Alliums, lilies, and Solomon's seal. Snake plants (Arisaema) and their
relation Sauromatum guttatum of the order Araceae are very common in the
woods. The striped spathe in some species of Arisaema bears a curious
resemblance to the head of a cobra uplifted to strike. Orchids decrease
as one proceeds westwards, but irises are much more common in Kashm&iacute;r
than in the Simla hills. The Kashm&iacute;r fritillaries include the beautiful
Crown Imperial.</p>

<p><b>Alpine Him&aacute;laya.</b>&mdash;In the Alpine Him&aacute;laya the scanty tree-growth is
represented by willows, junipers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> birches. After 12,000 or 12,500
feet it practically disappears. A dwarf shrub, Juniperus recurva, is
found clothing hillsides a good way above the two trees of the same
genus. Other alpine shrubs which may be noticed are two rhododendrons,
which grow on cliffs at an elevation of 10,000 to 14,000 feet, R.
campanulatum and R. lepidotum, Gaultheria nummularioides with its
black-purple berry, and Cassiope fastigiata, all belonging to the order
Ericaceae. The herbs include beautiful primulas, saxifrages, and
gentians, and in the bellflower order species of Codonopsis and
Cyananthus. Among Composites may be mentioned the tansies, Saussureas,
and the fine Erigeron multiradiatus common in the forest above Narkanda.
In the bleak uplands beyond the Him&aacute;laya tree-growth is very scanty, but
in favoured localities willows and the pencil cedar, Juniperus
pseudosabina, are found. The people depend for fuel largely on a hoary
bush of the Chenopod order, Eurotia ceratoides. In places a profusion of
the red Tibetan roses, Rosa Webbiana, lightens up the otherwise dreary
scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<h3>FORESTS</h3>


<p><b>Rights of State in Waste.</b>&mdash;Under Indian rule the State claimed full
power of disposing of the waste, and, even where an exclusive right in
the soil was not maintained, some valuable trees, e.g. the <i>deod&aacute;r</i> in
the Him&aacute;laya, were treated as the property of the R&aacute;ja. Under the tenure
prevailing in the hills the soil is the R&aacute;ja's, but the people have a
permanent tenant right in any land brought under cultivation with his
permission. In Kulu the British Government asserted its ownership of the
waste. In the south-western Panj&aacute;b, where the scattered hamlets had no
real boundaries, ample waste was allotted to each estate, and the
remainder was claimed as State property.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Forest.</b>&mdash;The lands in the Panj&aacute;b over which authority, varying
through many degrees from full ownership unburdened with rights of user
down to a power of control exercised in the interests of the surrounding
village communities, may be roughly divided into</p>

<tr><td align='left'>(<i>c</i>)</td><td align='left'>Scrub and grass <i>Jangal</i> in the Plains.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The first are forests of <i>deod&aacute;r</i>, blue pine, fir, and oak in the
Him&aacute;laya above the level of 5000 feet. The hill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> forests occupy the
lower spurs, the Siw&aacute;liks in Hoshy&aacute;rpur, etc., and the low dry hills of
the north-west. A strong growth of <i>ch&iacute;r</i> pine (Pinus longifolia) is
often found in the Him&aacute;laya between 3000 and 5000 feet. Below 3000 feet
is scrub forest, the only really valuable product being bamboo. The
hills in the north-western districts of the Panj&aacute;b and N.W.F. Province,
when nature is allowed to have its way, are covered with low scrub
including in some parts a dwarf palm (Nannorhops Ritchieana), useful for
mat making, and with a taller, but scantier growth of <i>phul&aacute;h&iacute;</i> (Acacia
modesta) and wild olive. What remains of the scrub and grass <i>jangal</i> of
the plains is to be found chiefly in the B&aacute;r tracts between the Sutlej
and the Jhelam. Much of it has disappeared, or is about to disappear,
with the advance of canal irrigation. Dry though the climate is the B&aacute;r
was in good seasons a famous grazing area. The scrub consisted mainly of
<i>jand</i> (Prosopis spicigera), <i>j&aacute;l</i> (Salvadora oleoides), the <i>kar&iacute;l</i>
(Capparis aphylla) and the <i>far&aacute;sh</i> (Tamarix articulata).</p>

<p><b>Management and Income of Forests.</b>&mdash;The Forest Department of the Panj&aacute;b
has existed singe 1864, when the first Conservator was appointed. In
1911-12 it managed 8359 square miles in the Panj&aacute;b consisting of:</p>



<div class='centered'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%" cellspacing="0" summary="Management and Income of Forests">
<tr><td align='left'>Reserved Forests</td><td align='left'>1844</td><td align='left'>square miles</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Protected Forests</td><td align='left'>5203</td><td align='left'>square miles</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Unclassed Forests</td><td align='left'>1312</td><td align='left'>square miles</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>It was also in charge of 235 square miles of reserved forest in the
Haz&aacute;ra district of the N.W.F. Province, and of 364 miles of fine
mountain forest in the native State of Bashahr. In addition a few
reserved forests have been made over as grazing areas to the Military
Department, and Deputy Commissioners are in charge of a very large area
of unclassed forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>No forest can be declared "reserved" or "protected" unless it is owned
in whole or in part by the State. It is enough if the trees or some of
them are the property of the Government. In order to safeguard all
private rights a special forest settlement must be made before a forest
can be declared to be "reserved." In the case of a protected forest it
is enough if Government is satisfied that the rights of the State and of
private persons have been recorded at a land revenue settlement. After
deducting income belonging to the year 1909-10 realized in 1910-11, the
average income of the two years ending 1911-12 was &pound;81,805 (Rs.
1,227,082) and the average expenditure &pound;50,954 (Rs. 764,309).</p>

<p><b>Sources of Income.</b>&mdash;In the mountain forests the chief source of income
is the <i>deod&aacute;r</i>, which is valuable both for railway sleepers and as
building timber. The blue pine is also of commercial value. <i>Deod&aacute;r</i>,
blue pine, and some <i>ch&iacute;r</i> are floated down the rivers to depots in the
plains. Firwood is inferior to cedar and pine, and the great fir forests
are too remote for profitable working at present. There are fine
mountain forests in Chitr&aacute;l, on the Safed Koh, and in Western
Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n, but these have so far not even been fully explored. The
value of the hill forests may be increased by the success which has
attended the experimental extraction of turpentine from the resin of the
<i>ch&iacute;r</i> pine. The bamboo forests of K&aacute;ngra are profitable. At present an
attempt is being made to acclimatize several species of Eucalyptus in
the low hills. The scrub <i>jangal</i> in the plains yields good fuel. As the
area is constantly shrinking it is fortunate that the railways have
ceased to depend on this source of supply, coal having to a great extent
taken the place of wood. To prevent shortage of fuel considerable areas
in the tracts commanded by the new canals are being reserved for
irrigated forests. A forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> of this class covering an area of 37 square
miles and irrigated from the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal has long existed at
Changa Manga in the Lahore district.</p>

<p><b>Forests in Kashm&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;The extensive and valuable Kashm&iacute;r forests are
mountain and hill forests, the former, which cover much the larger area
yielding, <i>deod&aacute;r</i>, blue pine, and firs, and the latter <i>ch&iacute;r</i> pine. The
total area exceeds 2600 square miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h3>BEASTS, BIRDS, FISHES, AND INSECTS</h3>


<p><b>Fauna.</b>&mdash;With the spread of cultivation and drainage the Panj&aacute;b plains
have ceased to be to anything like the old extent the haunt of wild
beasts and wild fowl. The lion has long been extinct and the tiger has
practically disappeared. Leopards are to be found in low hills, and
sometimes stray into the plains. Wolves are seen occasionally, and
jackals are very common. The black buck (Antilope cerricapra) can still
be shot in many places. The graceful little <i>chink&aacute;ra</i> or ravine deer
(Gazella Bennetti) is found in sandy tracts, and the hogdeer or <i>p&aacute;rha</i>
(Cervus porcinus) near rivers. The <i>n&iacute;lgai</i> (Boselaphus tragocamelus) is
less common. Monkeys abound in the hills and in canal-irrigated tracts
in the Eastern districts, where their sacred character protects them
from destruction, though they do much damage to crops. Peafowl are to be
seen in certain tracts, especially in the eastern Panj&aacute;b. They should
not be shot where the people are Hindus or anywhere near a Hindu shrine.
The great and lesser bustards and several kinds of sand grouse are to be
found in sandy districts. The grey partridge is everywhere, and the
black can be got near the rivers. The <i>s&iacute;s&iacute;</i> and the <i>chikor</i> are the
partridges of the hills, which are also the home of fine varieties of
pheasants including the <i>mon&aacute;l</i>. Quail frequent the ripening fields in
April and late in September. Duck of various kinds abound where there
are <i>jh&iacute;ls</i>, and snipe are to be got in marshy ground. The green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
parrots, crows, and vultures are familiar sights. Both the sharp-nosed
(Garialis Gangetica, vern. <i>ghari&aacute;l</i>) and the blunt-nosed (Crocodilus
palustris, vern. magar) crocodiles haunt the rivers. The fish are
tasteless; the <i>rohu</i> and <i>mahseer</i> are the best. Poisonous snakes are
the <i>karait</i>, the <i>cobra</i>, and Russell's viper. The first is sometimes
an intruder into houses. Lizards and mongooses are less unwelcome
visitors. White ants attack timber and ruin books, and mosquitoes and
sandflies add to the unpleasant features of the hot weather. The best
known insect pest is the locust, but visitations on a large scale are
rare. Of late years much more damage has been done by an insect which
harbours in the cotton bolls.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Shooting in Hills</span></h4>

<p><b>Shooting in Hills.</b>&mdash;The finest shooting in the north-west Him&aacute;laya is
probably to be got in Lad&aacute;kh and Baltist&aacute;n, but the trip is somewhat
expensive and requires more time than may be available. In many areas
licenses have to be obtained, and the conditions limit the number of
certain animals, and the size of heads, that may be shot. For example,
the permit in Chamba may allow the shooting of two red bear and two
<i>th&aacute;r</i>, and when these have been got the sportsman must turn his
attention to black bear and <i>gural</i>. Any one contemplating a shooting
expedition in the Him&aacute;laya should get from one who has the necessary
experience very complete instructions as to weapons, tents, clothing,
stores, etc.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Sport in the Plains</span></h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Black Buck Shooting.</b>&mdash;To get a good idea of what shooting in the
plains is like Major Glasford's <i>Rifle and Romance in the Indian Jungle</i>
may be consulted. As regards larger game the favourite sport is black
buck shooting. A high velocity cordite rifle is dangerous to the country
people, and some rifle firing black powder should be used. It is well to
reach the home of the herd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> soon after sunrise while it is still in the
open, and not among the crops. There will usually be one old buck in
each herd. He himself is not watchful, but his does are, and the herd
gallops off with great leaps at the first scent of danger, the does
leading and their lord and master bringing up the rear. If by dint of
careful and patient stalking you get to some point of vantage, say 100
yards from the big buck, it is worth while to shoot. Even if the bullet
finds its mark the quarry may gallop 50 yards before it drops. Good
heads vary from 20" to 24" or even more.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 26. Black buck.</span>
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Small game in Plains.</b>&mdash;The cold weather shooting begins with the
advent of the quail in the end of September and ends when they reappear
among the ripening wheat in April. The duck arrive from the Central
Asian lakes in November and duck and snipe shooting lasts till February
in districts where there are <i>jh&iacute;ls</i> and swampy land. For a decent shot
30 couple of snipe is a fair bag. To get duck the <i>jh&iacute;l</i> should be
visited at dawn and again in the evening, and it is well to post several
guns in favourable positions in the probable line of flight. 40 or 50
birds would be a good morning's bag. In drier tracts the bag will
consist of partridges and a hare or two, or, if the country is sandy,
some sand-grouse and perhaps a bustard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Incidence of Population in Panj&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;The estimated numbers of independent
tribes dwelling within the British sphere of influence is 1,600,000. The
incidence of the population on the total area of the Panj&aacute;b including
native States is 177 per square mile, which may be compared with 189 in
France and 287 in the British Isles. As the map shows, the density is
reduced by the large area of semi-desert country in the south-west and
by the mountainous tract in the north-east. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> distribution of the
population is the exact opposite of that which prevails in Great
Britain. There are only 174 towns as compared with 44,400 villages, and
nearly nine-tenths of the people are to be found in the latter. Some of
the so-called towns are extremely small, and the average population per
town is but 14,800 souls. There are no large towns in the European
sense. The biggest, Delhi and Lahore, returned respectively 232,837 and
228,687 persons.</p>

1891 amounted to 10 p.c. Plague,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> which has smitten the Panj&aacute;b more
severely than any other province, appeared in 1896, and its effect was
seen in the lower rate of expansion between 1891 and 1901.
Notwithstanding great extensions of irrigation and cultivation in the
Rechna Do&aacute;b the numbers declined by 2 p.c. between 1901 and 1911. In the
ten years from 1901 to 1910 in the British districts alone over two
million people died of plague and the death-rate was raised to 12 p.c.
above the normal. It actually exceeded the birth-rate by 2 p.c. Of the
total deaths in the decade nearly one in four was due to plague.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> The
part which has suffered most is the rich submontane tract east of the
Chen&aacute;b, Lahore and Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la, and some of the south-eastern districts.
A glance at the map will show how large the loss of population has been
there. It is by no means entirely due to plague. The submontane
districts were almost over-populated, and many of their people have
emigrated as colonists, tenants, and labourers to the waste tracts
brought under cultivation by the excavation of the Lower Chen&aacute;b and
Jhelam canals. The districts which have received very marked additions
of population from this cause are Jhang (21 p.c.), Sh&aacute;hpur (30 p.c.), and
Lyallpur (45 p.c.). Deaths from plague have greatly increased the
deficiency of females, which has always been a noteworthy feature. In
1911 the proportion had very nearly fallen to four females for every
five males.</p>

<p><b>Increase and Incidence in N.W.F. Province.</b>&mdash;The incidence of the
population in the area covered by the five districts of the N.W.F.
Province is 164 per square mile. The district figures are given in the
map in the margin. The increase between 1901 and 1911 in these districts
was 7&frac12; p.c. There have been no severe outbreaks of plague like those
which have decimated the population of some of the Panj&aacute;b districts.</p>

<p>General figures for the territory of the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja of Kashm&iacute;r are
meaningless. In the huge Indus valley the incidence is only 4 persons
per sq. mile. In Jammu and Kashm&iacute;r it is 138. The map taken from the
Census<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> Report gives the details. The increase in the decade was on
paper 8&frac12; p.c., distributed between 5&frac14; in Jammu, 12 in Kashm&iacute;r, and
14 in the Indus valley. A great part of the increase in the last must be
put down to better enumeration.</p>

<p><b>Health and duration of life.</b>&mdash;The climate of the Panj&aacute;b plains has
produced a vigorous, but not a long-lived, race. The mean age of the
whole population in the British districts is only 25. The normal
birth-rate of the Panj&aacute;b is about 41 per 1000, which exceeds the English
rate in the proportion of 5 to 3. In 1910 the recorded birth-rate in the
N.W.F. Province was 38 per 1000. Till plague appeared the Panj&aacute;b
death-rate averaged 32 or 33 per 1000, or more than double that of
England. The infantile mortality is enormous, and one out of every four
or five children fails to survive its first year. The death-rate in the
N.W.F. Province was 27 per 1000 in 1910. In the ten years ending 1910
plague pushed up the average death-rate in the Panj&aacute;b to 43&frac12; per
1000. Even now malarial fever is a far worse foe than plague. The
average annual deaths in the ten years ending 1910 were:</p>

<p>Fever is very rife in October and November, and these are the most
unhealthy months in the year, March and April being the best. The
variations under fevers and plague from year to year are enormous. In
1907 the latter claimed 608,685 victims, and the provincial death-rate
reached the appalling figure of 61 per 1000. Next year the plague
mortality dropped to 30,708, but there were 697,058 deaths from fever.
There is unfortunately no reason to believe that plague has spent its
force or that the people as a whole will in the near future generally
accept the protective measures of inoculation and evacuation.
Vaccination, the prejudice against which has largely disappeared, has
robbed the small-pox goddess of many offerings. As a general cause of
mortality the effect of cholera in the Panj&aacute;b is now insignificant. But
it is still to be feared in the Kashm&iacute;r valley, especially in the
picturesque but filthy summer capital. Syphilis is very common in the
hill country in the north-east of the province. Blindness and leprosy
are both markedly on the decrease. Both infirmities are common in
Kashm&iacute;r, especially the former. The rigours of the climate in a large
part of the State force the people to live day and night for the seven
winter months almost entirely in dark and smoky huts, and it is small
wonder that their eyesight is ruined.</p>

<p><b>Occupations.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b is preeminently an agricultural country, and
the same is true in an almost greater degree of the N.W.F. Province and
Kashm&iacute;r. The typical holding is that of the small landowner tilling from
3 to 10 acres with his own hands with or without help from village
menials. The tenant class is increasing, but there are still three
owners to two tenants. Together they make up 50 p.c. of the population
of the Panj&aacute;b, and 5 p.c. is added for farm labourers. Altogether,
according to the census returns 58 p.c. of the population<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> depends for
its support on the soil, 20.5 on industries, chiefly the handicrafts of
the weaver, potter, leather worker, carpenter, and blacksmith, 9.4 on
trade, 2.5 on professions, and 9.6 on other sources of livelihood.</p>

<p><b>Measures taken to protect agriculturists.</b>&mdash;In a country owned so largely
by small farmers, the first task of the Government must be to secure
their welfare and contentment. Before plague laid its grasp on the rich
central districts it was feared that they were becoming congested, and
the canal colonization schemes referred to in a later chapter were
largely designed to relieve them. But there is a much subtler foe to
whose insidious attacks small owners are liable, the temptation to abuse
their credit till their acres are loaded with mortgages and finally
lost. So threatening had this economic disease for years appeared that
at last in 1900 the Panj&aacute;b Alienation of Land Act was passed, which
forbade sales by people of agricultural tribes to other classes without
the sanction of the district officer, and greatly restricted the power
of mortgaging. The same restrictions are in force in the N.W.F.
Province. The Act is popular with those for whose benefit it was
devised, and has effected its object of checking land alienation and
probably to some extent discouraged extravagance. It has been
supplemented by a still more valuable measure, the Co-operative Credit
Societies Act. The growth of these societies in the Panj&aacute;b has been very
remarkable, a notable contrast to the very slow advance of the similar
movement in England. In 1913-14 there were 3261 village banks with
155,250 members and a working capital of 133&frac34; <i>lakhs</i> or &pound;885,149,
besides 38 central banks with a capital of 42&frac34; <i>lakhs</i> or about
&pound;285,000. Village banks held deposits amounting to nearly 37 <i>lakhs</i>,
more than half of which was received from non-members, and lent out
71&frac12; <i>lakhs</i> in the year to their members.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tribal Composition.</b>&mdash;Table I based on the Census returns shows the
percentages of the total population belonging to the chief tribes. The
classification into "land-holding, etc." is a rough one.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 31. Jat Sikh Officers (father and son).</span>
</div>


<p><b>Jats.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b is <i>par excellence</i> the home of the Jats. Everywhere
in the plains, except in the extreme north-west corner of the province,
they form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> a large element in the population. In the east they are
Hindus, in the centre Sikhs and Muhammadans, and in the west
Muhammadans. The Jat is a typical son of the soil, strong and sturdy,
hardworking and brave, a fine soldier and an excellent farmer, but
slow-witted and grasping. The Sikh Jat finds an honourable outlet for
his overflowing energy in the army and in the service of the Crown
beyond the bounds of India. When he misses that he sometimes takes to
dacoity. Unfortunately he is often given to strong drink, and, when his
passions or his greed are aroused, can be exceedingly brutal. Jat in the
Western Panj&aacute;b is applied to a large number of tribes, whose ethnical
affinities are somewhat dubious.</p>

<p><b>R&aacute;jputs.</b>&mdash;R&aacute;jputs are found in considerable numbers all over the
province except in a few of the western and south-western districts. As
farmers they are much hampered by caste rules which forbid the
employment of their women in the fields, and the prohibition of widow
remarriage is a severe handicap. They are generally classed as poor
cultivators, and this is usually, but by no means universally, a true
description. The Dogra R&aacute;jputs of the low hills are good soldiers. They
are numerous in K&aacute;ngra and in the Jammu province of Kashm&iacute;r.</p>

<p><b>Brahmans.</b>&mdash;The Brahmans of the eastern plains and north-eastern hills
are mostly agriculturists, and the Muhi&aacute;l Brahman of the north-western
districts is a landowner and a soldier. In the hills the Brahman is
often a shopkeeper. The priestly Brahman is found everywhere, but his
spiritual authority has always been far less in the Panj&aacute;b than in most
parts of India.</p>

<p><b>Biluches.</b>&mdash;When the frontier was separated off the Biluch district of
Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n with its strong tribal organization under chiefs or
<i>tumand&aacute;rs</i> was left in the Panj&aacute;b. The Biluches are a frank, manly,
truthful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> race, free from fanaticism and ready as a rule to follow their
chiefs. They are fine horsemen. Unfortunately it is difficult to get
them to enlist.</p>

<p><b>Path&aacute;ns.</b>&mdash;Both politically and numerically the Path&aacute;ns are the
predominant tribe in the N.W.F. Province, and are of importance in parts
of the Panj&aacute;b districts of Attock and Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;. The Path&aacute;n is a democrat
and often a fanatic, more under the influence of <i>mullahs</i> than of the
<i>maliks</i> or headmen of his tribe. He has not the frank straightforward
nature of the Biluch, is untiring in pursuit of revenge, and is not free
from cruelty. But, when he has eaten the <i>Sark&aacute;r's</i> salt, he is a very
brave and dashing soldier, and he is a faithful host to anyone whom he
has admitted under his roof.</p>

<p><b>Aw&aacute;ns.</b>&mdash;The home of the Aw&aacute;n in the Panj&aacute;b is the Salt Range and the
parts of Attock and Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;, lying to the north of it, and this tract
of country is known as the Aw&aacute;nk&aacute;r&iacute;. In the N.W.F. Province they are,
after the Path&aacute;ns, by far the largest tribe, and are specially numerous
in Pesh&aacute;war and Haz&aacute;ra.</p>

<p><b>Shekhs.</b>&mdash;Of the Shekhs about half are Kuresh&iacute;s, Sad&iacute;k&iacute;s, and Ans&aacute;r&iacute;s of
foreign origin and high social standing. The rest are new converts to
Isl&aacute;m, often of the sweeper caste originally.</p>

<p><b>Saiyyids.</b>&mdash;Saiyyids are unsatisfactory landowners, and are kept going by
the offerings of their followers. They are mostly Shias. It is not
necessary to believe that they are all descended from the Prophet's
son-in-law, Ali. A native proverb with pardonable exaggeration says:
"The first year I was a weaver (Jul&aacute;ha), the next year a Shekh. This
year, if prices rise, I shall be a Saiyyid."</p>

<p><b>Trading Castes.</b>&mdash;Aroras are the traders of the S.W. Panj&aacute;b and of the
N.W.F. Province. They share the Central Panj&aacute;b with the Khatr&iacute;s, who
predominate in the north-western districts. The Khatr&iacute; of the
R&aacute;walpind&iacute;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> division is often a landowner and a first-class fighting
man. Some of our strongest Indian civil officials have been Aroras. In
the Delhi division the place of the Arora and Khatr&iacute; is taken by the
Bania, and in K&aacute;ngra by the S&uacute;d or the Brahman. Khojas and Par&aacute;chas are
Muhammadan traders.</p>

<p><b>Artizans and Menials.</b>&mdash;Among artizans and menials Sun&aacute;rs (goldsmiths),
R&aacute;jes (masons), Loh&aacute;rs (blacksmiths), and Tarkh&aacute;ns (carpenters) take the
first rank.</p>

<p><b>Impure Castes.</b>&mdash;The vast majority of the impure castes, the
"untouchables" of the Hindu religion, are scavengers and workers in
leather. The sweeper who embraces Isl&aacute;m becomes a Musall&iacute;. The Sikh
Mazhb&iacute;s, who are the descendants of sweeper converts, have done
excellent service in our Pioneer regiments. The Hindu of the Panj&aacute;b in
his avoidance of "untouchables" has never gone to the absurd lengths of
the high caste Madr&aacute;s&iacute;, and the tendency is towards a relaxation of
existing restrictions.</p>

<p><b>Mendicants.</b>&mdash;Men of religion living on charity, wandering <i>fak&iacute;rs</i>, are
common sights, and beggars are met with in the cities, who sometimes
exhibit their deformities with unnecessary insistence.</p>

<p><b>Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;s.</b>&mdash;According to the census return the number of Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;
Musulm&aacute;ns, who make up 60 p.c. of the inhabitants of the Jhelam valley,
was 765,442. They are no doubt mostly descendants of various Hindu
castes, perhaps in the main of Hill Brahmans, but Isl&aacute;m has wiped out
all tribal distinctions. Sir Walter Lawrence wrote of them: "The
Kashm&iacute;r&iacute; is unchanged in spite of the splendid Moghal, the brutal
Afgh&aacute;n, and the bully Sikh. Warriors and statesmen came and went; but
there was no egress, and no wish ... in normal times to leave their
homes. The outside world was far, and from all accounts inferior to the
pleasant valley.... So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;s lived their self-centred life,
conceited, clever, and conservative."</p>

<p>The Hindu Kashm&iacute;r&iacute; Pandits numbered 55,276.</p>

<p><b>Tribes of Jammu.</b>&mdash;Agricultural Brahmans are numerous in the Jammu
province. Thakkars and Meghs are important elements of the population of
the outer hills. The former are no doubt by origin R&aacute;jputs, but they
have cast off many R&aacute;jput customs. The Meghs are engaged in weaving and
agriculture, and are regarded as more or less impure by the higher
castes.</p>

<p><b>G&uacute;jars.</b>&mdash;G&uacute;jars in the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja's territories are almost always
graziers. In 1911 they numbered 328,003.</p>

<p><b>Dard Tribes of Astor and Gilgit.</b>&mdash;The people of Astor and Gilgit are
Dards speaking Shina and professing Isl&aacute;m. Sir Aurel Stein wrote of
them: "The Dard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> race which inhabits the valleys N. of (the Inner
Him&aacute;laya) as far as the Hindu Kush is separated from the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;
population by language as well as by physical characteristics.... There
is little in the Dard to enlist the sympathies of the casual observer.
He lacks the intelligence, humour, and fine physique of the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;,
and, though undoubtedly far braver than the latter, has none of the
independent spirit and manly bearing which draw us towards the Path&aacute;n
despite all his failings. But I can never see a Dard without thinking of
the thousands of years of struggle they have carried on with the harsh
climate and the barren soil of their mountains<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>."</p>

<p><b>Kanj&uacute;t&iacute;s.</b>&mdash;The origin of the Kanj&uacute;t&iacute;s of Hunza is uncertain, and so are
the relationships of their language.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mongoloid Population of Lad&aacute;kh.</b>&mdash;The population of Lad&aacute;kh and B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n
is Mongoloid, but the B&aacute;lt&iacute;s (72,439) have accepted Isl&aacute;m and polygamy,
while the Lad&aacute;kh&iacute;s have adhered to Buddhism and polyandry.</p>

<p><b>Ethnological theories.</b>&mdash;In <i>The People of India</i> the late Sir Herbert
Risley maintained that the inhabitants of R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, nearly the whole of
the Panj&aacute;b, and a large part of Kashm&iacute;r, whatever their caste or social
status, belonged with few exceptions to a single racial type, which he
called Indo-Aryan. The Biluches of Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n and the Path&aacute;ns of
the N.W.F. Province formed part of another group which he called
Turko-Iranian. The people of a strip of territory on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> the west of the
Jamna he held to be of the same type as the bulk of the inhabitants of
the United Provinces, and this type he called Aryo-Dravidian. Finally
the races occupying the hills in the north-east and the adjoining part
of Kashm&iacute;r were of Mongol extraction, a fact which no one will dispute.
Of the Indo-Aryan type Sir Herbert Risley wrote: "The stature is mostly
tall, complexion fair, eyes dark, hair on face plentiful, head long,
nose narrow and prominent, but not specially long." He believed that the
Panj&aacute;b was occupied by Aryans, who came into the country from the west
or north-west with their wives and children, and had no need to contract
marriages with the earlier inhabitants. The Aryo-Dravidians of the
United Provinces resulted from a second invasion or invasions, in which
the Aryan warriors came alone and had to intermarry with the daughters
of the land, belonging to the race which forms the staple of the
population of Central India and Madras. This theory was based on
measurements of heads and noses, and it seems probable that deductions
drawn from these physical characters are of more value than any evidence
based on the use of a common speech. But it is hard to reconcile the
theory with the facts of history even in the imperfect shape in which
they have come down to us, or to believe that Sakas, Yuech&iacute;, and White
Huns (see historical section) have left no traces of their blood in the
province. If such there are, they may perhaps be found in some of the
tribes on both sides of the Salt Range, such as Gakkhars, Janj&uacute;as, Aw&aacute;ns
Tiw&aacute;nas, Ghebas, and Johdras, who are fine horsemen and expert
tent-peggers, not "tall heavy men without any natural aptitude for
horsemanship," as Sir Herbert Risley described his typical Panj&aacute;b&iacute; (p.
59 of his book).</p>

Kohist&aacute;n&iacute; are spoken in Astor, Gilgit, and Chil&aacute;s, and to the west of
Kashm&iacute;r territory in Chitr&aacute;l and the Kohist&aacute;n or mountainous country at
the top of the Sw&aacute;t river valley. Though Kashm&iacute;r&iacute; and the Shina-Khow&aacute;r
tongues belong to the Aryan group, their basis is supposed to be
non-Sanskritic, and it is held that there is a strong non-Sanskritic or
Pis&aacute;cha element also in Lahnd&iacute; or western Panj&aacute;b&iacute;, which is also the
prevailing speech in the Haz&aacute;ra and Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n districts of the
N.W.F. Province, and is spoken in part of the Jammu province of Kashm&iacute;r.
Pashtu is the common language in Pesh&aacute;war, Koh&aacute;t, and Bannu, and is
spoken on the western frontiers of Haz&aacute;ra and Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n, and in
the independent tribal territory in the west between the districts of
the N.W.F. Province and the Durand Line and immediately adjoining the
Pesh&aacute;war district on the north. R&aacute;jasth&aacute;n&iacute; is a collective name for the
dialects of R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, which overflow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> into the Panj&aacute;b, occupying a
strip along the southern frontier from Bah&aacute;walpur to Gurg&aacute;on. The
infiltration of English words and phrases into the languages of the
province is a useful process and as inevitable as was the enrichment of
the old English speech by Norman-French. But for the present the results
are apt to sound grotesque, when the traveller, who expects a train to
start at the appointed time, is told: "<i>tren late hai, lekin singal down
hogaya</i>" (the train is late, but the signal has been lowered), or the
criticism is passed on a popular officer: "<i>bahut affable hai, lekin
hand shake nah&iacute;n kart&aacute;</i>" (very affable, but doesn't shake hands).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PEOPLE (<i>continued</i>): RELIGIONS</h3>


<p><b>Religions in N.W.F. Province.</b>&mdash;In the N.W.F. Province an overwhelming
majority of the population professes Isl&aacute;m. In 1911 there were 2,039,994
Musalm&aacute;ns as compared with 119,942 Hindus, 30,345 Sikhs, and 6585
Christians.</p>

<p><b>Religions in Kashm&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;In Kashm&iacute;r the preponderance of Muhammadans is
not so overwhelming. The figures are:</p>



<div class='centered'>

<tr><td align='left'>Sikhs</td><td align='right'>31,553</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The Hindus belong mostly to the Jammu province, where nearly half of the
population professes that faith. The people of Kashm&iacute;r, B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n, Astor
and Gilgit, Chil&aacute;s and Hunza Nag&aacute;r, are Musalm&aacute;ns. The Lad&aacute;kh&iacute;s are
Buddhists.</p>

<p><b>Religions in Panj&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;The distribution by religions of the population of
the Panj&aacute;b and its native States in 1911 was:</p>



<div class='centered'>

</div>

<p>The strength of the Muhammadans is in the districts west of the Bi&aacute;s and
the Sutlej below its junction with the Bi&aacute;s. 83 p.c. of the subjects of
the Naw&aacute;b of Bah&aacute;walpur are also Muhammadans. In all this western region
there are few Hindus apart from the shopkeepers and traders. On the
other hand the hill country in the north-east is purely Hindu, except on
the borders of Tibet, where the scanty population professes Buddhism.
While Hinduism is the predominant faith in the south-east, quite a
fourth of the people there are Musalm&aacute;ns. Sikhs nowhere form a majority.
The districts in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> eastern part of the Central Plains where they
constitute more than one-fifth of the population are indicated in the
map. In six districts, Lahore, Montgomery, Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la, Lyallpur,
Hoshy&aacute;rpur, and Amb&aacute;la the proportion is between 10 and 20 p.c.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 37. Raghun&aacute;th Temple, Jammu.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Growth and Decline in numbers.</b>&mdash;There was a slight rise in the number of
Muhammadans between 1901 and 1911. Their losses in the central
districts, where the plague scourge has been heaviest, were
counterbalanced by gains in the western tract, where its effect has been
slight. On the other hand the decrease under Hindus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> amounts to nearly
15 p.c. The birth-rate is lower and the death-rate higher among Hindus
than among Musalm&aacute;ns, and their losses by plague in the central and some
of the south-eastern districts have been very heavy. A change of
sentiment on the part of the Sikh community has led to many persons
recording themselves as Sikhs who were formerly content to be regarded
as Hindus. It must be remembered that one out of four of the recorded
Hindus belongs to impure castes, who even in the Panj&aacute;b pollute food and
water by their touch and are excluded from the larger temples. Since
1901 a considerable number of Ch&uacute;hras or Sweepers have been converted to
Isl&aacute;m and Christianity.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 38. Golden Temple, Amritsar.</span>
</div>


<p><b>Sikhs.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding heavy losses by plague Sikhs have increased by
37 p.c. A great access of zeal has led to many more Sikhs becoming
<i>Kesdh&aacute;r&iacute;s</i>. <i>Sajhdh&aacute;r&iacute;s</i> or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> <i>M&uacute;nas</i>, who form over one-fifth of the
whole Sikh community, were in 1901 classed as Hindus. They are followers
of B&aacute;ba N&aacute;nak, cut their hair, and often smoke. When a man has taken the
"<i>pahul</i>," which is the sign of his becoming a <i>Kesdh&aacute;r&iacute;</i> or follower of
Guru Govind, he must give up the <i>hukka</i> and leave his hair unshorn. The
future of Sikhism is with the <i>Kesdh&aacute;r&iacute;s</i>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 39. Mosque in Lahore City.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Muhammadans.</b>&mdash;In the eastern districts the conversions to Isl&aacute;m were
political, and Hindu and Muhammadan R&aacute;jputs live peaceably together in
the same village. The Musalm&aacute;ns have their mosque for the worship of
Allah, but were, and are still, not quite sure that it is prudent wholly
to neglect the godlings. The conversion of the western Panj&aacute;b was the
result largely of missionary effort. <i>P&iacute;r&iacute; mur&iacute;d&iacute;</i> is a great
institution there. Every man should be the "<i>mur&iacute;d</i>" or pupil of some
holy man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> or <i>p&iacute;r</i>, who combines the functions in the Roman Catholic
Church of spiritual director in this world and the saint in heaven. The
<i>p&iacute;r</i> may be the custodian of some little saint's tomb in a village, or
of some great shrine like that of Baba Far&iacute;d at P&aacute;kpattan, or Bah&aacute;wal
Hakk at Mult&aacute;n, or Taunsa Sharif in Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n, or Golra in
R&aacute;walpind&iacute;. His own holiness may be more official than personal. About
1400 A.D. the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;s were offered by their Sult&aacute;n Sikandar the choice
between conversion and exile, and chose the easier alternative. Like the
western Panj&aacute;b&iacute;s they are above all things saint-worshippers. The
ejaculations used to stimulate effort show this. The embankment builder
in the south-western Panj&aacute;b invokes the holy breath of Bah&aacute;wal Hakk, and
the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute; boatman's cry "Y&aacute; P&iacute;r, dast g&iacute;r," "Oh Saint, lend me a
hand," is an appeal to their national saint.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Education.</b>&mdash;The Musalm&aacute;ns of the western Panj&aacute;b have a great
dislike to Sikhs, dating from the period of the political predominance
of the latter. So far the result of education has been to accentuate
religious differences and animosities. Both Sikhs and Musalm&aacute;ns are
gradually dropping ideas and observances retained in their daily life
after they ceased to call themselves Hindus. On the other hand, within
the Hindu fold laxity is now the rule rather than the exception, and the
neglect of the old ritual and restrictions is by no means confined to
the small but influential reforming minority which calls itself &Aacute;rya
Sam&aacute;j.</p>

<p><b>Christians.</b>&mdash;The number of Christians increased threefold between 1901
and 1911. The Presbyterian missionaries have been especially successful
in attracting large numbers of outcastes into the Christian Church.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 40. God and Goddess, Chamba.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Hinduism in the Panj&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;Hinduism has always been, and to-day is more
than ever, a very elastic term. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> Census Superintendent, himself a
high caste Hindu, wrote: "The definition which would cover the Hindu of
the modern times is that he should be born of parents not belonging to
some recognised religion other than Hinduism, marry within the same
limits, believe in God, respect the cow, and cremate the dead." There is
room in its ample folds for the &Aacute;rya Sam&aacute;jist, who rejects idol worship
and is divesting himself of caste prejudices and marriage restrictions,
and the most orthodox San&aacute;tan dharmist, who carries out the whole
elaborate daily ritual of the Brahmanical religion, and submits to all
its complicated rules; for the ordinary Hindu trader, who is equally
orthodox by profession, but whose ordinary religious exercises are
confined to bathing in the morning; for the villager of the eastern
districts, who often has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> the name of Parameshvar or the Supreme Lord on
his lips, but who really worships the godlings, G&uacute;g&aacute; P&iacute;r, Sarwar or
Sult&aacute;n P&iacute;r, S&iacute;tla (the small-pox goddess), and others, whose little
shrines we see round the village site; and for the childish idolaters of
Kulu, who carry their local deities about to visit each other at fairs,
and would see nothing absurd in locking them all up in a dungeon if rain
held off too long.</p>

<h3>THE PEOPLE (<i>continued</i>): EDUCATION</h3>


<p><b>Educational progress.</b>&mdash;According to the census returns of 1911 there are
not four persons per 100 in the province who are "literate" in the sense
of being able to read and write a letter. The proportion of literacy
among Hindus and Sikhs is three times as great as among Muhammadans. In
1911-12 one boy in six of school-going age was at school or college and
one girl in 37. This may seem a meagre result of sixty years of work,
for the Government and Christian missionaries, who have had an
honourable connection with the educational history of the province,
began their efforts soon after annexation, and a Director of Public
Instruction was appointed as long ago as 1856. But a country of small
peasant farmers is not a very hopeful educational field, and the rural
population was for long indifferent or hostile. If an ex-soldier of the
<i>Kh&aacute;lsa</i> had expressed his feelings, he would have used words like those
of the "Old Pind&aacute;r&iacute;" in Lyall's poem, while the Muhammadan farmer, had
he been capable of expressing his hostility, might have argued that the
teaching his son could get in a village school would help him not at all
in his daily work. Things are better now. We have improved our scheme of
teaching, and of late raised the pay of the teachers, which is, however,
still hardly adequate. Till a better class of teachers can be secured
for primary schools, the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> educational theories will not bear fruit
in practice. The old indifference is weakening, and the most hopeful
sign is the increasing interest taken in towns in female education, a
matter of the first importance for the future of the country.</p>

<p><b>Present position.</b>&mdash;The present position is as follows:&mdash;The Government
has made itself directly or indirectly responsible for the education of
the province. At the headquarters of each district there is a high
school for boys controlled by the Education Department. In each district
there are Government middle schools, Anglo-vernacular or Vernacular,
and primary schools, managed by the Municipal Committees and District
Boards. Each middle school has a primary, and each high school a primary
and a middle, department. For the convenience of pupils who cannot
attend school while living at home hostels are attached to many middle
and high schools. Fees are very moderate. In middle schools, where the
income covers 56 p.c. of the expenditure, they range from R. 1 (16
pence) monthly in the lowest class in which they are levied to Rs. 4 (5
shillings) in the highest class. In rural primary schools the children
of agriculturists are exempt because they pay local rate, and others,
when not exempt on the score of poverty, pay nominal fees. Besides the
Government schools there are aided schools of the above classes usually
of a sectarian character, and these, if they satisfy the standards laid
down, receive grants. There is a decreasing, but still considerable,
class of private schools, which make no attempt to satisfy the
conditions attached to these grants. The <i>mullah</i> in the mosque teaches
children passages of the Kur&aacute;n by rote, or the shopkeeper's son is
taught in a Mah&aacute;jan&iacute; school native arithmetic and the curious script in
which accounts are kept. A boys' school of a special kind is the Panj&aacute;b
Chiefs' College at Lahore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> intended for the sons of princes and men of
high social position.</p>

<p><b>Technical Schools.</b>&mdash;In an agricultural country like the Panj&aacute;b there is
not at present any large field for technical schools. The best are the
Mayo School of Art and the Railway Technical School at Lahore. The
latter is successful because its pupils can readily find employment in
the railway workshops. Mr Kipling, the father of the poet, when
principal of the former, did much for art teaching, and the present
principal, Bhai R&aacute;m Singh, is a true artist. The Government Engineering
School has recently been remodelled and removed to Ras&uacute;l, where the
head-works of the Lower Jhelam canal are situated.</p>

Singh.</i>)</span>
</div>


<p><b>Female Education.</b>&mdash;Female education is still a tender plant, but of late
growth has been vigorous. The Victoria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> May School in Lahore founded in
1908 has developed into the Queen Mary College, which provides an
excellent education for girls of what may be called the upper middle
class. There is a separate class for married ladies. Hitherto they have
only been reached by the teaching given in their own homes by missionary
ladies, whose useful work is now being imitated by the Hindu community
in Lahore. There is an excellent Hindu Girls' Boarding School in
Jalandhar. The Sikhs and the body of reformers known as the Dev Sam&aacute;j
have good girls' schools at Ferozepore. The best mission schools are the
Kinnaird High School at Lahore and the Alexandra School at Amritsar. The
North India School of Medicine for Women at Ludhi&aacute;na, also a missionary
institution, does admirable work. In the case of elementary schools the
difficulty of getting qualified teachers is even greater than as regards
boys' schools.</p>

<p><b>Education of European Children.</b>&mdash;There are special arrangements for the
education of European and Anglo-Indian children. In this department the
Roman Catholics have been active and successful. The best schools are
the Lawrence Asylum at San&aacute;war, Bishop Cotton's School, Auckland House,
and St Bede's at Simla, St Denys', the Lawrence Asylum, and the Convent
School at Murree.</p>

<p><b>The Panj&aacute;b University.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b University was constituted in 1882,
but the Government Arts College and Oriental College, the Medical
College and the Law School at Lahore, which are affiliated with it, are
of older date. The University is an examining body like London
University. Besides the two Arts Colleges under Government management
mentioned above there are nine private Arts Colleges aided by Government
grants and affiliated to the University. Four of these are in Lahore,
two, the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> the Di&aacute;l Singh Colleges, are Hindu
institutions, one, the Isl&aacute;mia College, is Muhammadan, the fourth is the
popular and efficient Forman Christian College. Four out of five art
students read in Lahore. Of the Arts colleges outside Lahore the most
important is the St Stephen's College at Delhi. The Kh&aacute;lsa School and
College at Amritsar is a Sikh institution. The Veterinary College at
Lahore is the best of its kind in India, and the Agricultural College at
Lyallpur is a well-equipped institution, which at present attracts few
pupils, but may play a very useful r&ocirc;le in the future. There is little
force in the reproach that we built up a super-structure of higher
education before laying a broad foundation of primary education. There
is more in the charge that the higher educational food we have offered
has not been well adapted to the intellectual digestions of the
recipients.</p>

<p><b>Education in N.W.F. Province, Native States, and I Kashm&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b
Native States and Kashm&iacute;r are much more backward as regards education
than the British Province. As is natural in a tract in which the
population is overwhelmingly Musalm&aacute;n by religion and farming by trade
the N.W.F. Province lags behind the Panj&aacute;b. Six colleges in the States
and the N.W.F. Province are affiliated to the Panj&aacute;b University.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h3>ROADS AND RAILWAYS</h3>


<p><b>Roads.</b>&mdash;The alignment of good roads in the plains of the Panj&aacute;b is easy,
and the deposits of calcareous nodules or <i>kankar</i> often found near the
surface furnish good metalling material. In the west the rainfall is so
scanty and in many parts wheeled traffic so rare that it is often wise
to leave the roads unmetalled. There are in the Panj&aacute;b over 2000 miles
of metalled, and above 20,000 miles of unmetalled roads. The greatest
highway in the world, the Grand Trunk, which starts from Calcutta and
ends at Pesh&aacute;war, passes through the province from Delhi in the
south-east to Attock in the extreme north-west corner, and there crosses
the Indus and enters the N.W.F. Province. The greater part of the
section from Karn&aacute;l to Lahore had been completed some years before the
Mutiny, that from Lahore to Pesh&aacute;war was finished in 1863-64. A great
loop road connects our arsenal at Ferozepore with the Grand Trunk Road
at Lahore and Ludhi&aacute;na. The fine metalled roads from Amb&aacute;la to K&aacute;lka,
and K&aacute;lka to Simla have lost much of their importance since the railway
was brought to the hill capital. Beyond Simla the K&aacute;lka-Simla road is
carried on for 150 miles to the Shipk&iacute; Pass on the borders of Tibet,
being maintained as a very excellent hill road adapted to mule carriage.
A fine tonga road partly in the plains and partly in the hills joins
Murree with R&aacute;walpind&iacute;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> From Murree it drops into the Jhelam valley
crossing the river and entering Kashm&iacute;r at Koh&aacute;la. It is carried up the
gorge of the Jhelam to B&aacute;ram&uacute;la and thence through the Kashm&iacute;r valley to
Sr&iacute;nagar. A motor-car can be driven all the way from R&aacute;walpind&iacute; to
Sr&iacute;nagar. In the N.W.F. Province a great metalled road connects
Pesh&aacute;war, Koh&aacute;t, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n.</p>

<p><b>Railways. Main Lines.</b>&mdash;It is just over fifty years since the first
railway, a short line joining Lahore and Amritsar, was opened in 1862.
Three years later Lahore was linked up with Mult&aacute;n and the small
steamers which then plied on the Indus. Amritsar was connected with
Delhi in 1870, and Lahore with Pesh&aacute;war in 1883. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> line from Pesh&aacute;war
to Lahore, and branching thence to Kar&aacute;ch&iacute; and Delhi may be considered
the Trunk Line. The railway service has been enormously developed in the
past thirty years. In 1912 there were over 4000 miles of open lines.
There are now three routes from Delhi to Lahore:</p>

</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The N.W. Railway <i>via</i> Meerut and Sah&aacute;ranpur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> (on east of Jamna),
and Amb&aacute;la, Ludhi&aacute;na, Jalandhar, Amritsar;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Southern Panj&aacute;b Railway <i>via</i> Jind, Rohtak, Bhatinda, and
Ferozepore;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Delhi-Amb&aacute;la-K&aacute;lka branch of the East Indian Rallway from
Delhi through Karn&aacute;l to Amb&aacute;la, and thence by the N.W. Railway. This is
the shortest route.</p>

<p>The Southern Panj&aacute;b Railway also connects Delhi with Kar&aacute;ch&iacute; through its
junction with the N.W. Railway at Samasata to the south of Bah&aacute;walpur.
Another route is by a line passing through Rew&aacute;r&iacute; and the Merta
junction. Kar&aacute;ch&iacute; is the natural seaport of the central and western
Panj&aacute;b. The S.P. Railway now gives an easy connection with Ferozepore
and Ludhi&aacute;na, and the enormous export of wheat, cotton, etc. from the
new canal colonies is carried by several lines which converge at
Khanew&aacute;l, a junction on the main line, a little north of Mult&aacute;n.</p>

<p><b>Railways. Minor Lines.</b>&mdash;The Sind S&aacute;gar branch starting from L&aacute;la Musa
between Lahore and Amritsar with smaller lines taking off further north
at Golra and Campbellpur serves the part of the province lying north of
the Salt Range. These lines converge at Kundian in the Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;
district, and a single line runs thence southwards to points on the
Indus opposite Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n and Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n, and turning
eastwards rejoins the trunk line at Sher Sh&aacute;h near Mult&aacute;n. There are a
number of branch lines in the plains, some owned by native States.
Strategically a very important one is that which crossing the Indus by
the Khush&aacute;lgarh bridge unites R&aacute;walpind&iacute; with Koh&aacute;t. The only hill
railway is that from K&aacute;lka to Simla. A second is now under construction
which, when completed, will connect R&aacute;walpind&iacute; with Sr&iacute;nagar. All these
lines with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> exception of the branch of the E.I. Railway mentioned
above are worked by the staff of the N. W. State Railway, whose manager
controls inside and outside the Panj&aacute;b some 5000 miles of open line. The
interest earned in 1912 was 4&frac12; p.c., a good return when it is
considered that the parts of the system to the north of the Salt Range
and the Sind S&aacute;gar railway were built primarily for strategic reasons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h3>CANALS</h3>


<p><b>Importance of Canals.</b>&mdash;One need have no hesitation in placing among the
greatest achievements of British rule in the Panj&aacute;b the magnificent
system of irrigation canals which it has given to the province. Its
great alluvial plain traversed by large rivers drawing an unfailing
supply of water from the Himalayan snows affords an ideal field for the
labours of the canal engineer. The vastness of the arid areas which
without irrigation yield no crops at all or only cheap millets and
pulses makes his works of inestimable benefit to the people and a source
of revenue to the State.</p>

<p><b>Canals before annexation.</b>&mdash;In the west of the province we found in
existence small inundation canals dug by the people with some help from
their rulers. These only ran during the monsoon season, when the rivers
were swollen. In 1626 Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n's Persian engineer, Ali Mard&aacute;n Kh&aacute;n,
brought to Delhi the water of the canal dug by Firoz Sh&aacute;h as a monsoon
channel and made perennial by Akbar. But during the paralysis of the
central power in the eighteenth century the channels became silted up.
The same able engineer dug a canal from the R&aacute;v&iacute; near M&aacute;dhopur to water
the royal gardens at Lahore. What remained of this work at annexation
was known as the Hasl&iacute;.</p>

<p><b>Extent of Canal Irrigation.</b>&mdash;In 1911-12, when the deficiency of the
rainfall made the demand for water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> keen, the canals of the Panj&aacute;b and
the N.W.F. Province irrigated 8&frac12; millions of acres. The figures are:</p>

<p>On the Sirhind Canal, on which the demand fluctuates greatly with the
character of the season, the area was twice the normal. The three canals
of the Triple Project will, when fully developed, add 1,871,000 acres to
the irrigated area of the Panj&aacute;b, and the Upper Sw&aacute;t Canal will increase
that of the N.W.F. Province by 381,000 acres. The canals will therefore
in a year of drought be able to water over ten millions of acres without
taking account of possible extensions if a second canal should be drawn
from the Sutlej. The money spent from imperial funds on Panj&aacute;b canals
has exceeded twelve millions sterling, and no money has ever been better
spent. In, when the area irrigated was a good deal less than in, the
value of the crops raised by the use of canal water was estimated at
about 207 millions of rupees or nearly &pound;14,000,000. It is only possible
to note very briefly the steps by which this remarkable result has been
achieved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Western Jamna Canal.</b>&mdash;Soon after the assumption of authority at Delhi in
1803 the question of the old Canal from the Jamna was taken up. The
Delhi Branch was reopened in 1819, and the H&aacute;ns&iacute; Branch six years later.
In the famine year nearly 400,000 acres were irrigated. For more than
half a century that figure represented the irrigating capacity of the
canal. The English engineers in the main retained the faulty Moghal
alignment, and waterlogging of the worst description developed. The
effect on the health of the people was appalling. After long delay the
canal was remodelled. The result has been most satisfactory in every
way. In the last decade of the nineteenth century the Sirsa Branch and
the Nardak Distributary were added, to carry water to parts of the
Karn&aacute;l and Hiss&aacute;r districts where any failure of the monsoon resulted in
widespread loss of crops. If a scheme to increase the supply can be
carried out, further extension in tracts now very liable to famine will
become possible. In the six years ending the interest earned exceeded 8
p.c.</p>

<p><b>Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal.</b>&mdash;The headworks of the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal are
above M&aacute;dhopur near the point where the R&aacute;v&iacute; leaves the hills. The work
was started soon after annexation, but only finished in 1859. Irrigation
has grown from 90,000 acres in to 533,000 in, 861,000 in 1900-1, and
1,157,000 in. The later history of the canal consists mainly of great
extensions in the arid Lahore district, and the irrigation there is now
three-fifths of the whole. In parts of Amritsar, and markedly near the
city, waterlogging has become a grave evil, but remedial measures have
now been undertaken. The interest earned on the capital expenditure in
the six years ending averaged 11&frac12; p.c.</p>

<p><b>Sirhind Canal.</b>&mdash;A quarter of a century passed after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b
Canal began working before the water of the Sutlej was used for
irrigation. The Sirhind Canal weir is at Rupar where the river emerges
from the Siw&aacute;liks. Pati&aacute;la, J&iacute;nd, and N&aacute;bha contributed to the cost, and
own three of the five branches. But the two British branches are
entitled to nearly two-thirds of the water, which is utilized in the
Ludhi&aacute;na and Ferozepore districts and in the Far&iacute;dkot State. The soil of
the tract commanded is for the most part a light sandy loam, and in
years of good rainfall it repays dry cultivation. The result is that the
area watered fluctuates largely. But in the six years ending the
interest earned averaged 7 p.c., and the power of expansion in a bad
year is a great boon to the peasantry.</p>

<p><b>Canal extensions in Western Panj&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;In the last quarter of a century
the chief task of the Canal Department in the Panj&aacute;b has been the
extension of irrigation to the Rechna and Jech Do&aacute;bs and the lower part
of the B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b. All three contained large areas of waste belonging to
the State, mostly good soil, but incapable of cultivation owing to the
scanty rainfall. Colonization has therefore been an important part of
all the later canal projects. The operations have embraced the
excavation of five canals.</p>

<p><b>Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal.</b>&mdash;The Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal is one of the greatest
irrigation works in the world, the area commanded being 3-1/3 million
acres, the average discharge four or five times that of the Thames at
Teddington, and the average irrigated area 2&frac14; million acres. There
are three main branches, the Rakh, the Jhang, and the Gugera. The supply
is secured by a great weir built across the Chen&aacute;b river at Kh&aacute;nk&iacute; in
the Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la district, and the irrigation is chiefly in the
Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la, Lyallpur, and Jhang districts. In the four years ending the
average interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> earned was 28 p.c., and in future the rate should
rarely fall below 30 p.c. The capital expenditure has been a little over
&pound;2,000,000. The interest charges were cleared about five years after the
starting of irrigation, and the capital has already been repaid to the
State twice over.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Lower Jhelam Canal.</b>&mdash;The Lower Jhelam Canal, which waters the tract
between the Jhelam and Chen&aacute;b in the Sh&aacute;hpur and Jhang districts, is a
smaller and less profitable work. The culturable commanded area is about
one million acres. The head-works are at Ras&uacute;l in the Gujr&aacute;t district.
Irrigation began in 1901. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> four years ending 1911-12 the average
area watered was 748,000 acres and the interest earned exceeded 10 p.c.</p>

<p><b>Triple Project&mdash;Upper Jhelam and Upper Chen&aacute;b Canals and Lower B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b
Canal.</b>&mdash;The Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal takes the whole available supply of the
Chen&aacute;b river. But it does not command a large area in the Rechna Do&aacute;b
lying in the west of Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la, in which rain cultivation is very risky
and well cultivation is costly. No help can be got from the R&aacute;v&iacute;, as the
Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal exhausts its supply. Desirable as the extension of
irrigation in the areas mentioned above is, the problem of supplying it
might well have seemed insuperable. The bold scheme known as the Triple
Project which embraces the construction of the Upper Jhelam, Upper
Chen&aacute;b, and Lower B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canals, is based on the belief that the
Jhelam river has even in the cold weather water to spare after feeding
the Lower Jhelam Canal. The true <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the Upper Jhelam
Canal, whose head-works are at Mangla in Kashm&iacute;r a little north of the
Gujr&aacute;t district, is to throw a large volume of water into the Chen&aacute;b at
Kh&aacute;nk&iacute;, where the Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal takes off, and so set free an equal
supply to be taken out of the Chen&aacute;b higher up at Mer&aacute;la in Si&aacute;lkot,
where are the head-works of the Upper Chen&aacute;b Canal. But the Upper Jhelam
Canal will also water annually some 345,000 acres in Gujr&aacute;t and Sh&aacute;hpur.
The Upper Chen&aacute;b Canal will irrigate 648,000 acres mostly in Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la,
and will be carried across the R&aacute;v&iacute; by an aqueduct at Balloke in the
south of Lahore. Henceforth the canal is known as the Lower B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b,
which will water 882,000 acres, mostly owned by the State, in the
Montgomery and Mult&aacute;n districts. On the other two canals the area of
Government land is not large. The Triple Project is approaching
completion, and irrigation from the Upper Chen&aacute;b<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> Canal has begun. The
engineering difficulties have been great, and the forecast does not
promise such large gains as even the Lower Jhelam Canal. But a return of
7&frac12; p.c. is expected.</p>

<p><b>Monsoon or Inundation Canals.</b>&mdash;The numerous monsoon or inundation
canals, which take off from the Indus, Jhelam, Chen&aacute;b, R&aacute;v&iacute;, and Sutlej,
though individually petty works, perform an important office in the
thirsty south-western districts. By their aid a <i>khar&iacute;f</i> crop can be
raised without working the wells in the hot weather, and with luck the
fallow can be well soaked in autumn, and put under wheat and other
spring crops. For the maturing of these crops a prudent cultivator
should not trust to the scanty cold weather rainfall, but should
irrigate them from a well. The Sidhnai has a weir, but may be included
in this class, for there is no assured supply at its head in the R&aacute;v&iacute; in
the winter. In 1910-11 the inundation canals managed by the State
watered 1,800,000 acres. There are a number of private canals in
Ferozepore, Sh&aacute;hpur, and the hill district of K&aacute;ngra. In Ferozepore the
district authorities take a share in the management.</p>

<p><b>Colonization of Canal Lands.</b>&mdash;The colonization of huge areas of State
lands has been an important part of new canal schemes in the west of the
Panj&aacute;b. When the Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal was started the population of the
vast B&aacute;r tract which it commands consisted of a few nomad cattle owners
and cattle thieves. It was a point of honour to combine the two
professions. Large bodies of colonists were brought from the crowded
districts of the central Panj&aacute;b. The allotments to peasants usually
consisted of 55 acres, a big holding for a man who possibly owned only
four or five acres in his native district. There were larger allotments
known as yeoman and capitalist grants, but the peasants are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> the only
class who have turned out quite satisfactory farmers. Colonization began
in 1892 and was practically complete by 1904, when over 1,800,000 acres
had been allotted. To save the peasants from the evils which an
unrestricted right of transfer was then bringing on the heads of many
small farmers in the Panj&aacute;b it was decided only to give them permanent
inalienable tenant right. The Panj&aacute;b Alienation of Land Act, No. XIII of
1900, has supplied a remedy generally applicable, and the peasant
grantees are now being allowed to acquire ownership on very easy terms.
The greater part of the colony is in the new Lyallpur district, which
had in 1911 a population of 857,511 souls.</p>

<p>On the Lower Jhelam Canal the area of colonized land exceeds 400,000
acres. A feature of colonization on that canal is that half the area is
held on condition of keeping up one or more brood mares, the object
being to secure a good class of remounts. Succession to these grants is
governed by primogeniture. On the Lower B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal a very large
area is now being colonized.</p>

<p><b>Canals of the N.W.F. Province.</b>&mdash;Hemmed in as the N.W.F. Province is
between the Indus and the Hills, its canals are insignificant as
compared with the great irrigation works of the Panj&aacute;b. The only ones of
any importance are in the Pesh&aacute;war Valley. These draw their supplies
from the K&aacute;bul, B&aacute;ra, and Sw&aacute;t rivers, but the works supplied by the
first two streams only command small areas. The Lower Sw&aacute;t Canal was
begun in 1876, but the tribesmen were hostile and the diggers had to
sleep in fortified enclosures. The work was not opened till 1885. A reef
in the river has made it possible to dispense with a permanent weir. The
country is not an ideal one for irrigation, being much cut up by
ravines. But a large area has been brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> under command, and the
irrigation has more than once exceeded 170,000 acres. In 1911-12 it was
157,650 acres, and the interest earned was 9&frac34; p.c. The Upper Sw&aacute;t
Canal, which was opened in April 1914, was a more ambitious project,
involving the tunnelling at the M&aacute;lakand of 11,000 feet of solid rock.
The commanded area is nearly 450,000 acres, including 40,000 beyond our
administrative frontier. The estimated cost is Rs. 18,240,000 or over
&pound;1,200,000 and the annual irrigation expected is 381,562 acres.</p>

<h3>AGRICULTURE AND CROPS</h3>


<p><b>Classification by Zones.</b>&mdash;In order to give an intelligible account of
the huge area embraced by the Panj&aacute;b, N.W.F. Province, and Kashm&iacute;r it is
necessary to make a division of the area into zones. Classification must
be on very broad lines based on differences of altitude, rainfall, and
soil, leading to corresponding differences in the cultivation and the
crops. For statistical purposes districts must be taken as a whole,
though a more accurate classification would divide some of them between
two zones.</p>

<p><b>Classes of Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The broadest division of cultivation is into
irrigated and unirrigated, the former including well (<i>ch&aacute;h&iacute;</i>), canal
(<i>nahr&iacute;</i>), and <i>&aacute;b&iacute;</i>. The last term describes a small amount of land
watered from tanks or <i>jh&iacute;ls</i> in the plains and a larger area in the
hills irrigated by <i>kuhls</i> or small artificial channels. "Unirrigated"
embraces cultivation dependent on rain (<i>b&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;</i>) or on flooding or
percolation from rivers (<i>sail&aacute;b</i>). (See Table II.)</p>

<p><b>Harvests.</b>&mdash;There are two harvests, the autumn or <i>khar&iacute;f</i>, and the
spring or <i>rab&iacute;</i>. The autumn crops are mostly sown in June and July and
reaped from September to December. Cotton is often sown in March. Cane
planted in March and cut in January and February is counted as a
<i>khar&iacute;f</i> crop. The spring crops are sown from the latter part of
September to the end of December.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> They are reaped in March and April.
Roughly in the Panj&aacute;b three-fifths of the crops belong to the spring
harvest. In the N.W.F. Province the proportion is somewhat higher. In
Kashm&iacute;r the autumn crop is by far the more important.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 48. Persian Wheel Well and Ekka.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Implements of Husbandry and Wells.</b>&mdash;The implements of husbandry are
simple but effective in a land where as a rule there is no advantage in
stirring up the soil very deep. With his primitive plough (<i>hal</i>) and a
wooden clodcrusher (<i>soh&aacute;ga</i>) the peasant can produce a tilth for a crop
like cane which it would be hard to match in England. There are two
kinds of wells, the <i>charsa</i> or rope and bucket well and the <i>harat</i> or
Persian wheel.</p>

<p><b>Rotations.</b>&mdash;The commonest rotation in ordinary loam soils is to put in a
spring and autumn crop in succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> and then let the land lie fallow
for a year. Unless a good deal of manure is available this is the course
to follow, even in the case of irrigated land. Some poor hard soils are
only fit for crops of coarse rice sown after the embanked fields have
been filled in the monsoon by drainage from surrounding waste. Other
lands are cropped only in the autumn because the winter rainfall is very
scanty. Flooded lands are often sown only for the spring harvest.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 49. A drove of goats&mdash;Lahore.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Cattle, Sheep, and Goats.</b>&mdash;In 1909 there were in the British districts
of the Panj&aacute;b 4&frac14; million bullocks and 625,000 male buffaloes
available to draw 2,169,000 ploughs and 288,000 carts, thresh the corn,
and work a quarter of a million wells, besides sugar, oil, and flour
mills. The cattle of the hills, N.W. Panj&aacute;b, and riverain tracts are
undersized, but in the uplands of the Central Panj&aacute;b and S.E. districts
fine oxen are used. The horned cattle share 18 millions of pasture land,
much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> extremely poor, with 4 million sheep and 5&frac12; million goats.
Hence the enormous area devoted to fodder crops.</p>

<p><b>Zones.</b>&mdash;Six zones can be distinguished, but, as no district is wholly
confined to the mountain zone, it must for statistical purposes be
united to the submontane zone:</p>

<p><b>Mountain and Submontane Zones.</b>&mdash;In the Mountain Zone the fields are
often very minute, consisting of narrow terraces supported by stone
revetments built up the slopes of hills. That anyone should be ready to
spend time and labour on such unpromising material is a sign of pressure
of population on the soil, which is a marked feature of some hill
tracts.</p>

</div>

<p>Below 8000 feet the great crop is maize. Potatoes have been introduced
near our hill stations. The chief pulse of the mountain zone is <i>kulath</i>
(Dolichos biflorus), eaten by the very poor. Wheat ascends to 8000 or
9000 feet, and at the higher levels is reaped in August. Barley is grown
at much greater heights. Buckwheat (<i>&uacute;gal</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> <i>tr&uacute;mba</i>, <i>dr&aacute;w&iacute;</i>),
amaranth (<i>chaul&aacute;&iacute;</i>, <i>ganh&aacute;r</i>, <i>sari&aacute;ra</i>), and a tall chenopod (<i>bathu</i>)
are grown in the mountain zone. Buckwheat is common on poor stony lands.</p>

</div>

<p>The only comparatively flat land is on the banks above river beds, which
are devoted to rice cultivation, the water being conducted to the
embanked fields by an elaborate system of little canals or <i>kuhls</i>. This
is the only irrigation in the mountains, and is much valued. The
Submontane Zone has a rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches. Well irrigation
is little used and the dry crops are generally secure. Wheat and maize
are the great staples, but gram and <i>char&iacute;</i>, i.e. <i>jow&aacute;r</i> grown for
fodder, are also important. Some further information about Kashm&iacute;r
agriculture will be found in a later chapter. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> full details about
classes of cultivation and crops in all the zones Tables II, III and IV
should be consulted.</p>

<p><b>North Central Panj&aacute;b Plain.</b>&mdash;The best soils and the finest tillage are
to be found in the North Central Zone. Gujr&aacute;t has been included in it,
though it has also affinities in the north with the North-West area, and
in the south with the South-Western plain. The rainfall varies from 25
to 35 inches. One-third of the cultivated area is protected by wells,
and the well cultivation is of a very high class in Ludhi&aacute;na and
Jalandhar, where heavily manured maize is followed by a fine crop of
wheat, and cane is commonly grown. In parts of Si&aacute;lkot and Gujr&aacute;t the
well cultivation is of a different type, the area served per well being
large and the object being to protect a big acreage of wheat in the
spring harvest. The chief crops in this zone are wheat and <i>char&iacute;</i>. The
latter is included under "Other Fodder" in Tables III and IV.</p>

<p><b>North-Western Area.</b>&mdash;The plateau north of the Salt Range has a very
clean light white sandy loam soil requiring little ploughing and no
weeding. It is often very shallow, and this is one reason for the great
preference for cold weather crops. <i>Khar&iacute;f</i> crops are more liable to be
burned up. Generally speaking the rainfall is from 15 to 25 inches, the
proportion falling in the winter and spring being larger than elsewhere.
There is, except in Pesh&aacute;war and Bannu, where the conditions involve a
considerable divergence from the type of this zone, practically no canal
irrigation. The well irrigation is unimportant and in most parts
consists of a few acres round each well intensively cultivated with
market-gardening crops. The dry crops are generally very precarious. In
Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; the Indus valley is a fine tract, but the harvests fluctuate
greatly with the extent of the floods. The Thal in Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; to the south
of the Sind S&aacute;gar railway is really a part of the next zone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The South-Western Plains.</b>&mdash;This zone contains nine districts. With the
exception of the three on the north border of the zone they have a
rainfall of from 5 to 10 inches. Of these six arid districts, only one,
Montgomery, has any dry cultivation worth mentioning. In the zone as a
whole three-fourths of the cultivation is protected by canals or wells,
or by both. In the lowlands near the great rivers cultivation depends on
the floods brought to the land direct or through small canals which
carry water to parts which the natural overflow would not reach. In the
uplands vast areas formerly untouched by the plough have been brought
under tillage by the help of perennial canals, and the process of
reclamation is still going on. The Thal is a large sandy desert which
becomes more and more worthless for cultivation as one proceeds
southwards. In the north the people have found out of late years that
this unpromising sand can not only yield poor <i>khar&iacute;f</i> crops, but is
worth sowing with gram in the spring harvest. The expense is small, and
a lucky season means large profits. In Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n a large area of
"<i>pat</i>" below the hills is dependent for cultivation on torrents. The
favourite crop in the embanked fields into which the water is diverted
is <i>jow&aacute;r</i>.</p>

<p><b>The South-Eastern Plains.</b>&mdash;In the south-eastern Panj&aacute;b except in Hiss&aacute;r
and the native territory on the border of R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, the rainfall is
from 20 to 30 inches. In Hiss&aacute;r it amounts to some 15 inches. These are
averages; the variations in total amount and distribution over the
months of the year are very great. In good seasons the area under dry
crops is very large, but the fluctuations in the sown acreage are
extraordinary, and the matured is often far below the sown area. The
great crops are gram and mixtures of wheat or barley with gram in the
spring, and <i>b&aacute;jra</i> in the autumn, harvest. Well cultivation is not of
much importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> generally, though some of it in the Jamna riverain is
excellent. The irrigated cultivation depends mainly on the Western Jamna
and Sirhind canals, and the great canal crops are wheat and cotton. This
is the zone in which famine conditions are still most to be feared.</p>

<p>In the Panj&aacute;b as a whole about one-third of the cultivated area is
yearly put under wheat, which with <i>b&aacute;jra</i> and maize is the staple food
of the people. A large surplus of wheat and oil-seeds is available for
export.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<h3>HANDICRAFTS AND MANUFACTURES</h3>


<p><b>Handicrafts.</b>&mdash;The chief handicrafts of the province are those of the
weaver, the shoemaker, the carpenter, the potter, and the worker in
brass and copper. The figures of the 1911 census for each craft
including dependents were: weavers 883,000; shoemakers 540,000;
carpenters 381,000; potters and brickmakers 349,000; metalworkers
240,000. The figures for weavers include a few working in factories. The
hand-spun cotton-cloth is a coarse strong fabric known as "<i>khaddar</i>"
with a single warp and weft. "<i>Khes</i>" is a better article with a double
warp and weft. "<i>S&uacute;s&iacute;</i>" is a smooth cloth with coloured stripes used for
women's trousers. A superior kind of checked "<i>khes</i>" known as
"<i>gabr&uacute;n</i>" is made at Ludhi&aacute;na. The native process of weaving is slow
and the weavers are very poor. The Salvation Army is trying to introduce
an improved hand loom. Fine "<i>lung&iacute;s</i>" or turbans of cotton with silk
borders are made at Ludhi&aacute;na, Mult&aacute;n, Pesh&aacute;war, and elsewhere. Effective
cotton printing is carried on by very primitive methods at Kot Kam&aacute;lia
and Lahore. Ludhi&aacute;na and Lahore turn out cotton <i>dar&iacute;s</i> or rugs. Coarse
woollen blankets or <i>lo&iacute;s</i> are woven at various places, and coloured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
felts or <i>namdas</i> are made at Ludhi&aacute;na, Khush&aacute;b, and Pesh&aacute;war. Excellent
imitations of Persian carpets are woven at Amritsar, and the Sr&iacute;nagar
carpets do credit to the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;s' artistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> taste. The best of the
Amritsar carpets are made of <i>pashm</i>, the fine underwool of the Tibetan
sheep, and <i>pashm&iacute;na</i> is also used as a material for <i>choghas</i>
(dressing-gowns), etc. Coarse woollen cloth or <i>pattu</i> is woven in the
K&aacute;ngra hills for local use. At Mult&aacute;n useful rugs are made whose fabric
is a mixture of cotton and wool. More artistic are the Biluch rugs made
by the Biluch women with geometrical patterns. These are excellent in
colouring. They are rather difficult to procure as they are not made for
sale. The weaving of China silk is a common industry in Amritsar,
Bah&aacute;walpur, Mult&aacute;n, and other places. The <i>phulk&aacute;r&iacute;</i> or silk embroidery
of the village maidens of Hiss&aacute;r and other districts of the Eastern
Panj&aacute;b, and the more elaborate gold and silver wire embroideries of the
Delhi <i>baz&aacute;rs</i>, are excellent. The most artistic product of the plains
is the ivory carving of Delhi. As a wood-carver the Panj&aacute;b&iacute; is not to be
compared with the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute;. His work is best fitted for doorways and the
bow windows or <i>bokh&aacute;rchas</i> commonly seen in the streets of old towns.
The best carvers are at Bhera, Chiniot, Amritsar, and Bat&aacute;la. The
European demand has produced at Simla and other places an abundant
supply of cheap articles of little merit. The inlaid work of Chiniot and
Hoshy&aacute;rpur is good, as is the lacquer-work of P&aacute;kpattan. The papier
mach&eacute; work of Kashm&iacute;r has much artistic merit (Fig. 55), and some of the
repouss&eacute; silver work of Kashm&iacute;r is excellent.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 53. Shoemaker&#39;s craft.</span>
</div>

<p>The craft of the <i>thathera</i> or brass worker is naturally most prominent
in the Eastern Panj&aacute;b, because Hindus prefer brass vessels for cooking
purposes. Delhi is the great centre, but the trade is actively carried
on at other places, and especially at Jag&aacute;dhr&iacute;.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>Unglazed pottery is made practically in every village. The blue
enamelled pottery of Mult&aacute;n and the glazed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> Delhi china ware are
effective. The manufacture of the latter is on a very petty scale.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 55. Papier mach&eacute; work <b>of</b> Kashm&iacute;r.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Factories.</b>&mdash;The factory industries of the Panj&aacute;b are still very small.
In 1911 there were 268 factories employing 28,184 hands. The typical
Panj&aacute;b factory is a little cotton ginning or pressing mill. The grinding
of flour and husking of rice are sometimes part of the same business.
The number of these mills rose in the 20 years ending 1911 from 12 to
202, and there are complaints that there are now too many factories.
Cotton-spinning has not been very successful and the number of mills in
1911, eight, was the same as in 1903-4. The weaving is almost entirely
confined to yarn of low counts. Part is used by the hand-loom weavers
and part is exported to the United Provinces. Good woollen fabrics are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
turned out at a factory at Dh&aacute;riw&aacute;l in the Gurd&aacute;spur district. There
were in 1911 fifteen flour mills, ten ironworks, three breweries, and
one distillery.</p>

Singh.</i>)</span>
</div>


<p><b>Joint-Stock Companies.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b has not reached the stage where the
joint-stock business successfully takes the place of the family banking
or factory business. In 1911 there were 194 joint-stock companies. But
many of these were provident societies, the working of which has been
attended with such abuses that a special act has been passed for their
control. A number of banks and insurance companies have also sprung up
of late years. Of some of these the paid up capital is absurdly small,
and the recent collapse of the largest and of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> smaller native banks
has drawn attention to the extremely risky nature of the business done.
Of course European and Hindu family banking businesses of the old type
stand on quite a different footing. Some of the cotton and other mills
are joint-stock concerns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>EXPORTS AND IMPORTS</h3>


<p><b>Trade.</b>&mdash;In 1911-12 the exports from the Panj&aacute;b, excluding those by land
to Central Asia, Lad&aacute;kh, and Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, were valued at Rs.
27,63,21,000 (&pound;18,421,000), of which 61 p.c. went to Kar&aacute;ch&iacute; and about
10 p.c. to Calcutta and Bombay. Of the total 27 p.c. consisted of wheat,
nearly the whole of which was dispatched to Kar&aacute;ch&iacute;. All other grains
and pulses were about equal in value to the wheat. "Gram and other
pulses" (18 p.c. of total exports) was the chief item. Raw cotton
accounts for 15, and oil-seeds for 10 p.c. The imports amounted in value
to Rs. 30,01,28,000 (&pound;20,008,000), little more than one-third being
received from Kar&aacute;ch&iacute;. Cotton piece goods (Foreign 22, Indian 8&frac12;
p.c.) make up one-third of the total. The other important figures are
sugar 12, and metals 11 p.c. The land trade with Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, Central
Asia, and Lad&aacute;kh is insignificant, but interesting as furnishing an
example of modes of transport which have endured for many centuries, and
of the pursuit of gain often under appalling physical difficulties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<h3>HISTORY&mdash;PRE-MUHAMMADAN PERIOD, 500 B.C.&mdash;1000 A.D.</h3>


<p><b>In Hindu period relations of Panj&aacute;b were with western kingdoms.</b>&mdash;The
large tract included in the British province of the Panj&aacute;b which lies
between the Jamna and the Ghagar is, having regard to race, language,
and past history, a part of Hindust&aacute;n. Where "Panj&aacute;b" is used without
qualification in this section the territories west of the Ghagar and
south of Kashm&iacute;r are intended. The true relations of the Panj&aacute;b and
Kashm&iacute;r during the Hindu period were, except for brief intervals, with
Persia, Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, and Turkist&aacute;n rather than with the great kingdoms
founded in the valley of the Ganges and the Jamna.</p>

<p><b>Normal division into petty kingdoms and tribal confederacies.</b>&mdash;The
normal state of the Panj&aacute;b in early times was to be divided into a
number of small kingdoms and tribal republics. Their names and the areas
which they occupied varied from time to time. Names of kingdoms that
have been rescued from oblivion are Gandh&aacute;ra, corresponding to Pesh&aacute;war
and the valley of the K&aacute;bul river, Urasa or Haz&aacute;ra, where the name is
still preserved in the Orash plain, T&aacute;xila, which may have corresponded
roughly to the present districts of R&aacute;walpind&iacute; and Attock with a small
part of Haz&aacute;ra, Abhisara or the low hills of Jammu, Kashm&iacute;r, and
Trigartta, with its capital Jalandhara, which occupied most of the
Jalandhar division<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> north of the Sutlej and the states of Chamba, Suket,
and Mand&iacute;. The historians of Alexander's campaigns introduce us also to
the kingdoms of the elder Poros on both banks of the Jhelam, of the
younger Poros east of the Chen&aacute;b, and of Sophyt&eacute;s (Saubhut&iacute;) in the
neighbourhood of the Salt Range. We meet also with tribal confederacies,
such as in Alexander's time those of the Kathaioi on the upper, and of
the Malloi on the lower, R&aacute;v&iacute;.</p>

<p><b>Invasion by Alexander, 327-325 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></b>&mdash;The great Persian king, Darius, in
512 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> pushed out the boundary of his empire to the Indus, then
running in a more easternly course than to-day<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The army with which
Xerxes invaded Greece included a contingent of Indian bowmen<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. When
Alexander overthrew the Persian Empire and started on the conquest of
India, the Indus was the boundary of the former. His remarkable campaign
lasted from April, 327 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when he led an army of 50,000 or 60,000
Europeans across the Hindu Kush into the K&aacute;bul valley, to October, 325,
when he started from Sindh on his march to Persia through Makr&aacute;n. Having
cleared his left flank by a campaign in the hills of Buner and Sw&aacute;t, he
crossed the Indus sixteen miles above Attock near Torbela. The King of
T&aacute;xila, whose capital was near the Margalla pass on the north border of
the present R&aacute;walpind&iacute; district, had prudently submitted as soon as the
Macedonian army appeared in the K&aacute;bul valley. From the Indus Alexander
marched to T&aacute;xila, and thence to the Jhelam (Hydaspes), forming a camp
near the site now occupied by the town of that name in the country of
Poros. The great army of the Indian king was drawn up to dispute the
passage probably not very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> far from the eastern end of the present
railway bridge. Favoured by night and a monsoon rain-storm&mdash;it was the
month of July, 326 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;Alexander succeeded in crossing some miles
higher up into the Karr&iacute; plain under the low hills of Gujr&aacute;t. Here,
somewhere near the line now occupied by the upper Jhelam Canal, the
Greek soldiers gave the first example of a feat often repeated since,
the rout of a large and unwieldy Indian army by a small, but mobile and
well-led, European force. Having defeated Poros, Alexander crossed the
Chen&aacute;b (Akesines), stormed S&aacute;ngala, a fort of the Kathaioi on the upper
R&aacute;v&iacute; (Hydraotes) and advanced as far as the Bi&aacute;s (Hyphasis). But the
weary soldiers insisted that this should be the bourn of their eastward
march, and, after setting up twelve stone altars on the farther side,
Alexander in September, 326 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, reluctantly turned back. Before he
left the Panj&aacute;b he had hard fighting with the Malloi on the lower R&aacute;v&iacute;,
and was nearly killed in the storm of one of their forts. Alexander
intended that his conquests should be permanent, and made careful
arrangements for their administration. But his death in June, 323 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
put an end to Greek rule in India. Chandra Gupta Maurya expelled the
Macedonian garrisons, and some twenty years later Seleukos Nicator had
to cede to him Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n.</p>

<p><b>Maurya Dominion and Empire of A&#351;oka, 323-231 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></b>&mdash;Chandra Gupta is
the Sandrakottos, to whose capital at Pataliputra (Patna) Seleukos sent
Megasthenes in 303 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The Greek ambassador was a diligent and truthful
observer, and his notes give a picture of a civilized and complex system
of administration. If Chandra Gupta was the David, his grandson,
A&#351;oka, was the Solomon of the first Hindu Empire. His long reign,
lasting from 273 to 231 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, was with one exception a period of
profound peace deliberately maintained by an emperor who, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> his
conversion to the teaching of Gautama Buddha, thought war a sin.
A&#351;oka strove to lead his people into the right path by means of pithy
abstracts of the moral law of his master graven on rocks and pillars. It
is curious to remember that this missionary king was peacefully ruling a
great empire in India during the twenty-four years of the struggle
between Rome and Carthage, which we call the first Punic War. Of the
four Viceroys who governed the outlying provinces of the empire one had
his headquarters at T&aacute;xila. One of the rock edicts is at Mansehra in
Haz&aacute;ra and another at Sh&aacute;hb&aacute;zgarh&iacute; in Pesh&aacute;war. From this time and for
many centuries the dominant religion in the Panj&aacute;b was Buddhism, but the
religion of the villages may then have been as remote from the State
creed as it is to-day from orthodox Brahmanism.</p>

<p><b>Graeco-Bactrian and Graeco-Parthian Rule.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b slipped from the
feeble grasp of A&#351;oka's successors, and for four centuries it looked
not to the Ganges, but to the K&aacute;bul and the Oxus rivers.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 57. Coin&mdash;obverse and reverse of Menander.</span>
</div>

<p>Up to the middle of the first century of our era it was first under
Graeco-Bactrian, and later under Graeco-Parthian, rule directly, or
indirectly through local rulers with Greek names or S&aacute;ka Satraps. The
S&aacute;kas, one of the central Asian shepherd hordes, were pushed out of
their pastures on the upper Jaxartes by another horde,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> the Yuech&iacute;.
Shadowy Hellenist Princes have left <b>us</b> only their names on coins; one
Menander, who ruled about 150 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, is an exception. He anticipated the
feats of later rulers of K&aacute;bul by a temporary conquest of North-Western
India, westwards to the Jamna and southwards to the sea.</p>

<p><b>The Kush&aacute;n Dynasty.</b>&mdash;The Yuech&iacute; in turn were driven southward to the
Oxus and the K&aacute;bul valley and under the Kush&aacute;n dynasty established their
authority in the Panj&aacute;b about the middle of the first century. The most
famous name is that of Kanishka, who wrested from China Kashg&aacute;r,
Yarkand, and Khotan, and assembled <b>a</b> notable council of sages of the law
in Kashm&iacute;r. His reign may be dated from 120 to 150 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> His capital was
at Purushapura (Pesh&aacute;war), near which he built the famous relic tower of
Buddha, 400 feet high. Beside the tower was a large monastery still
renowned in the ninth and tenth centuries as a home of sacred learning.
The rule of Kush&aacute;n kings in the Panj&aacute;b lasted till the end of the first
quarter of the third century. To their time belong the Buddhist
sculptures found in the tracts near their Pesh&aacute;war capital (see also
page <a href='#Page_204'><b>204</b></a>).</p>

<p><b>The Gupta Empire.</b>&mdash;Of the century preceding the establishment in 320
B.C. of the Gupta dynasty at Patna we know nothing. The Panj&aacute;b probably
again fell under the sway of petty r&aacute;jas and tribal confederacies,
though the Kush&aacute;n rule was maintained in Pesh&aacute;war till 465 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, when it
was finally blotted out by the White Huns. These savage invaders soon
after defeated Skanda Gupta, and from this blow the Gupta Empire never
recovered. At the height of its power in 400 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> under Chandra Gupta
II, known as Vikramaditya, who is probably the original of the
Bikramaj&iacute;t of Indian legends, it may have reached as far west as the
Chen&aacute;b.</p>

<p><b>The White Huns or Ephthalites.</b>&mdash;In the beginning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the sixth century
the White Hun, Mahirakula, ruled the Panj&aacute;b from Sakala, the modern
Si&aacute;lkot. He was a worshipper of &#350;iva, and a deadly foe of the
Buddhist cult, and has been described as a monster of cruelty.</p>

<p>The short-lived dominion of the White Huns was destroyed by the Turks
and Persians about the year 565 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p><b>Panj&aacute;b in seventh century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></b>&mdash;From various sources, one of the most
valuable being the Memoirs of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hiuen Tsang,
who travelled in India from 630 to 644 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, we know something of
Northern India in the first half of the seventh century. Hiuen Tsang was
at Kanauj as a guest of a powerful king named Harsha, whose first
capital was at Thanesar, and who held a suzerainty over all the r&aacute;jas
from the Brahmaputra to the Bi&aacute;s. West of that river the king of Kashm&iacute;r
was also overlord of T&aacute;xila, Urasa, Parnotsa (Punch), R&aacute;japur&iacute; (Rajaur&iacute;)
and Sinhapura, which seems to have included the Salt Range. The Pesh&aacute;war
valley was probably ruled by the Turk&iacute; Shahiya kings of K&aacute;bul. The rest
of the Panj&aacute;b was divided between a kingdom called by Hiuen Tsang
Tsekhia, whose capital was somewhere near Si&aacute;lkot, and the important
kingdom of Sindh, in which the Indus valley as far north as the Salt
Range was included. Harsha died in 647 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> and his empire collapsed.</p>

<p><b>Kashm&iacute;r under Hindu Kings.</b>&mdash;For the next century China was at the height
of its power. It established a suzerainty over Kashm&iacute;r, Udy&aacute;na (Sw&aacute;t),
Yas&iacute;n, and Chitr&aacute;l. The first was at this period a powerful Hindu
kingdom. Its annals, as recorded in Kalhana's R&aacute;jatarangin&iacute;, bear
henceforward a real relation to history. In 733 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> King Muktapida
L&aacute;lit&aacute;ditya received investiture from the Chinese Emperor. Seven years
later he defeated the King of Kanauj on the Ganges. A ruler who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> carried
his arms so far afield must have been very powerful in the Northern
Panj&aacute;b. The remains of the wonderful M&aacute;rtand temple, which he built in
honour of the Sun God, are a standing memorial of his greatness. The
history of Kashm&iacute;r under its Hindu kings for the next 400 years is for
the most part that of a wretched people ground down by cruel tyrants. A
notable exception was Avantidharman&mdash;855-883 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&mdash;whose minister,
Suyya, carried out very useful drainage and irrigation works.</p>

<p><b>The Panj&aacute;b, 650-1000 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></b>&mdash;We know little of Panj&aacute;b history in the 340
years which elapsed between the death of Harsha and the beginning of the
Indian raids of the Sultans of Ghazn&iacute; in 986-7 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> The conquest of the
kingdom of Sindh by the Arab general, Muhammad K&aacute;sim, occurred some
centuries earlier, in 712 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Mult&aacute;n, the city of the Sun-worshippers,
was occupied, and part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> at least of the Indus valley submitted to the
youthful conqueror. He and his successors in Sindh were tolerant rulers.
No attempt was made to occupy the Central Panj&aacute;b, and when the Turkish
Sult&aacute;n, Sabaktagin, made his first raid into India in 986-7 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, his
opponent was a powerful r&aacute;ja named Jaip&aacute;l, who ruled over a wide
territory extending from the Hakra to the frontier hills on the
north-west. His capital was at Bhatinda. Just about the time when the
rulers of Ghazn&iacute; were laying the train which ended at Delhi and made it
the seat of a great Muhammadan Empire, that town was being founded in
993-4 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> by the Tunwar R&aacute;jputs, who then held sway in that
neighbourhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<h3>HISTORY (<i>continued</i>). THE MUHAMMADAN PERIOD, 1000-1764 A.D.</h3>


<p><b>The Ghaznevide Raids.</b>&mdash;In the tenth century the Turks were the
janissaries of the Abbaside Caliphs of Baghd&aacute;d, and ambitious soldiers
of that race began to carve out kingdoms. One Alptagin set up for
himself at Ghazn&iacute;, and was succeeded in 976 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> by his slave
Sabaktagin, who began the long series of Indian raids which stained with
blood the annals of the next half-century. His son, Mahm&uacute;d of Ghazn&iacute;, a
ruthless zealot and robber abroad, a patron of learning and literature
at home, added the Panj&aacute;b to his dominions. In the first 26 years of the
eleventh century he made seventeen marauding excursions into India. In
the first his father's opponent, Jaip&aacute;l, was beaten in a vain effort to
save Pesh&aacute;war. Ten years later his successor, Anandp&aacute;l, at the head of a
great army, again met the Turks in the Khaibar. The valour of the
Ghakkars had practically won the day, when Anandp&aacute;l's elephant took
fright, and this accident turned victory into rout. In one or other of
the raids Mult&aacute;n and Lahore were occupied, and the temples of K&aacute;ngra
(Nagarkot) and Thanesar plundered. In 1018 the Turkish army marched as
far east as Kanauj. The one permanent result of all these devastations
was the occupation of the Panj&aacute;b. The Turks made Lahore the capital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Decline of Buddhism.</b>&mdash;The iconoclastic raids of Mahm&uacute;d probably gave the
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to Buddhism. Its golden age may be put at from 250 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
to 200 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Brahmanism gradually emerged from retirement and reappeared
at royal courts. It was quite ready to admit Buddha to its pantheon, and
by so doing it sapped the doctrine he had taught. The Chinese pilgrim,
Fahien, in the early part of the fifth century could still describe
Buddhism in the Panj&aacute;b as "very flourishing," and he found numerous
monasteries. The religion seems however to have largely degenerated into
a childish veneration of relics.</p>

<p><b>Conquest of Delhi.</b>&mdash;For a century and a quarter after the death of
Mahm&uacute;d in 1030 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> his line maintained its sway over a much diminished
empire. In 1155 the Afgh&aacute;n chief of Ghor, Al&aacute; ud d&iacute;n, the "World-burner"
(Jah&aacute;n-soz), levelled Ghazn&iacute; with the ground. For a little longer the
Ghaznevide Turkish kings maintained themselves in Lahore. Between 1175
and 1186 Muhammad Ghor&iacute;, who had set up a new dynasty at Ghazn&iacute;,
conquered Mult&aacute;n, Peshawar, Si&aacute;lkot, and Lahore, and put an end to the
line of Mahm&uacute;d. The occupation of Sirhind brought into the field Prithv&iacute;
R&aacute;ja, the Chauh&aacute;n R&aacute;jput king of Delhi. In 1191 he routed Muhammad Ghor&iacute;
at Nar&aacute;ina near Karn&aacute;l. But next year the Afgh&aacute;n came back with a huge
host, and this time on the same battlefield fortune favoured him.
Prithv&iacute; R&aacute;ja was taken and killed, and Muhammad's slave, Kutbudd&iacute;n
Aibak, whom he left to represent him in India, soon occupied Delhi. In
1203 Muhammad Ghor&iacute; had to flee for his life after a defeat near the
Oxus. The Ghakkars seized the chance and occupied Lahore. But the old
lion, though wounded, was still formidable. The Ghakkars were beaten,
and, it is said, converted. A year or two later they murdered their
conqueror in his tent near the Indus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Turkish and Afgh&aacute;ns Sult&aacute;ns of Delhi.</b>&mdash;He had no son, and his strong
viceroy, Kutbudd&iacute;n Aibak, became in 1206 the first of the 33 Muhammadan
kings, who in five successive dynasties ruled from Delhi a kingdom of
varying dimensions, till the last of them fell at P&aacute;nipat in 1526, and
B&aacute;bar, the first of the Moghals, became master of their red fort palace.
The blood-stained annals of these 320 years can only be lightly touched
on. Under vigorous rulers like the Turk&iacute; Slave kings, Altamsh
(1210-1236) and Balban (1266-1287), a ferocious and masterful boor like
Al&aacute; ud d&iacute;n Khalj&iacute; (1296-1316), or a ferocious but able man of culture
like Muhammad Tughlak (1325-1351), the local governors at Lahore and
Mult&aacute;n were content to be servants. In the frequent intervals during
which the royal authority was in the hands of sottish wastrels, the
chance of independence was no doubt seized.</p>

<p><b>Mongol Invasions.</b>&mdash;In 1221 the Mongol cloud rose on the north-west
horizon. The cruelty of these camel-riding Tatars and the terror they
inspired may perhaps be measured by the appalling picture given of their
bestial appearance. In 1221, Chingiz Kh&aacute;n descended on the Indus at the
heels of the King of Khwarizm (Khiva), and drove him into Sindh. Then
there was a lull for twenty years, after which the Mongol war hordes
ruined and ravaged the Panj&aacute;b for two generations. Two great Panj&aacute;b
governors, Sher Kh&aacute;n under Balban and Tughlak under Al&aacute; ud d&iacute;n Khalj&iacute;,
maintained a gallant struggle against these savages. In 1297 and 1303
the Mongols came to the gates of Delhi, but the city did not fall, and
soon after they ceased to harry Northern India. During these years the
misery of the common people must often have been extreme. When foreign
raids ceased for a time they were plundered by their own rulers. In the
Panj&aacute;b the fate of the peasantry must have depended chiefly on the
character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> of the governor for the time being, and of the local
feudatories or <i>zam&iacute;nd&aacute;rs</i>, who were given the right to collect the
State's share of the produce on condition of keeping up bodies of armed
men for service when required.</p>

<p><b>The Invasion of Tim&uacute;r.</b>&mdash;The long reign of Muhammad Tughlak's successor,
Firoz Sh&aacute;h (1351-1388), son of a Hindu R&aacute;jput princess of Dip&aacute;lpur,
brought relief to all classes. Besides adopting a moderate fiscal
policy, he founded towns like Hiss&aacute;r and Fateh&aacute;b&aacute;d, dug canals from the
Jamna and the Sutlej, and carried out many other useful works. On his
death the realm fell into confusion. In 1398-99 another appalling
calamity fell upon it in the invasion of Tim&uacute;rlang (Tamerlane), Kh&aacute;n of
Samarkand. He entered India at the head of 90,000 horsemen, and marched
by Mult&aacute;n, Dip&aacute;lpur, Sirsa, Kaithal, and P&aacute;nipat to Delhi. What lust of
blood was to the Mongols, religious hatred was to Tim&uacute;r and his Turks.
Ten thousand Hindus were put to the sword at Bhatner and 100,000
prisoners were massacred before the victory at Delhi. For the three
days' sack of the royal city Tim&uacute;r was not personally responsible. Sated
with the blood of lakhs of infidels sent "to the fires of Hell" he
marched back through K&aacute;ngra and Jammu to the Indus. Six years later the
House of Tughlak received a deadly wound when the Waz&iacute;r, Ikb&aacute;l Khan,
fell in battle with Khizr Kh&aacute;n, the governor of Mult&aacute;n.</p>

<p><b>The later Dynasties.</b>&mdash;The Saiyyids, who were in power from 1414 to 1451,
only ruled a small territory round Delhi. The local governors and the
Hindu chiefs made themselves independent. Sikandar Lod&iacute; (1488-1518)
reduced them to some form of submission, but his successor, Ibrah&iacute;m,
drove them into opposition by pushing authority further than his power
justified. An Afgh&aacute;n noble, Daulat Kh&aacute;n, rebelled in the Panj&aacute;b. There
is always an ear at K&aacute;bul listening to the first sounds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> discord and
weakness between Pesh&aacute;war and Delhi. B&aacute;bar, a descendant of Tim&uacute;r, ruled
a little kingdom there. In 1519 he advanced as far as Bhera. Five years
later his troops burned the Lahore <i>baz&aacute;r</i>, and sacked Dip&aacute;lpur. The
next winter saw B&aacute;bar back again, and this time Delhi was his goal. On
the 21st of April, 1526, a great battle at P&aacute;nipat again decided the
fate of India, and B&aacute;bar entered Delhi in triumph.</p>

<p><b>Akbar and his successors.</b>&mdash;He soon bequeathed his Indian kingdom to his
son Hum&aacute;yun, who lost it, but recovered it shortly before his death by
defeating Sikandar Sur at Sirhind. In 1556 Akbar succeeded at the age of
13, and in the same year Bahram Kh&aacute;n won for his master a great battle
at P&aacute;nipat and seated the Moghals firmly on the throne. For the next
century and a half, till their power declined after the death of
Aurangzeb in 1707, K&aacute;bul and Delhi were under one rule, and the Panj&aacute;b
was held in a strong grasp. When it was disturbed the cause was
rebellions of undutiful sons of the reigning Emperor, struggles between
rival heirs on the Emperor's death, or attempts to check the growing
power of the Sikh Gurus. The empire was divided into <i>s&uacute;bahs</i>, and the
area described in this book embraced <i>s&uacute;bahs</i> Lahore and Mult&aacute;n, and
parts of <i>s&uacute;bahs</i> Delhi and K&aacute;bul. Kashm&iacute;r and the trans-Indus tract
were included in the last.</p>

<p><b>The Sult&aacute;ns of Kashm&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;The Hindu rule in Kashm&iacute;r had broken down by
the middle of the twelfth century. A long line of Musalm&aacute;n Sult&aacute;ns
followed. Two notable names emerge in the end of the fourteenth and the
first half of the fifteenth century, Sikandar, the "Idol-breaker," who
destroyed most of the Hindu temples and converted his people to Isl&aacute;m,
and his wise and tolerant successor, Zain-ul-&aacute;bid&iacute;n. Akbar conquered
Kashm&iacute;r in 1587.</p>

<p><b>Moghal Royal Progresses to Kashm&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;His successors often moved from
Delhi by Lahore, Bhimbar, and the P&iacute;r<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Panj&aacute;l route to the Happy Valley
in order to escape the summer heats. Bernier has given us a graphic
account of Aurangzeb's move to the hills in 1665. On that occasion his
total following was estimated to amount to 300,000 or 400,000 persons,
and the journey from Delhi to Lahore occupied two months. The burden
royal progresses on this scale must have imposed on the country is
inconceivable. Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r died in his beloved Kashm&iacute;r. He planted the road
from Delhi to Lahore with trees, set up as milestones the <i>kos min&aacute;rs</i>,
some of which are still standing, and built fine <i>sarais</i> at various
places.</p>

<p><b>Prosperity of Lahore under Akbar, Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r, and Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n.</b>&mdash;The reigns
of Akbar and of his son and grandson were the heyday of Lahore. It was
the halfway house between Delhi and Kashm&iacute;r, and between Agra and K&aacute;bul.
The Moghal Court was often there. Akbar made the city his headquarters
from 1584 to 1598. Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r was buried and Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n was born at Lahore.
The mausoleum of the former is at Sh&aacute;hdara, a mile or two from the city.
Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n made the Sh&aacute;lim&aacute;r garden, and Ali Mard&aacute;n Kh&aacute;n's Canal, the
predecessor of our own Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal, was partly designed to
water it. Lahore retained its importance under Aurangzeb, till he became
enmeshed in the endless Deccan wars, and his successor, Bah&aacute;dur Shah,
died there in 1712.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p><b>B&aacute;ba N&aacute;nak, the first Guru.</b>&mdash;According to Sikh legend B&aacute;bar in one of
his invasions had among his prisoners their first Guru, B&aacute;ba N&aacute;nak, and
tried to make him a Musalm&aacute;n. N&aacute;nak was born in 1469 at Talwand&iacute;, now
known as Nank&aacute;na S&aacute;hib, 30 miles to the south-west of Lahore, and died
twelve years after B&aacute;bar's victory at P&aacute;nipat. He journeyed all over
India, and, if legend speaks true, even visited Mecca. His propaganda
was a peaceful one. A man of the people himself, he had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> message to
deliver to a peasantry naturally impatient of the shackles of orthodox
Hinduism. Sikhism is the most important of all the later dissents from
Brahmanism, which represent revolts against idolatry, priestly
domination, and the bondage of caste and ritual. These things N&aacute;nak
unhesitatingly condemned, and in the opening lines of his Japj&iacute;, the
morning service which every true Sikh must know by heart, he asserted in
sublime language the unity of God.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 59. B&aacute;ba N&aacute;nak and the Musician Mard&aacute;na.</span>
</div>


<p><b>The Gurus between N&aacute;nak and Govind.</b>&mdash;The first three successors of N&aacute;nak
led the quiet lives of great eastern saints. They managed to keep on
good terms with the Emperor and generally also with his local
representatives. The fifth Guru, Arjan (1581-1606), began the welding of
the Sikhs into a body fit to play a part in secular politics. He
compiled their sacred book, known as the <i>Granth S&aacute;hib</i>, and made
Amritsar the permanent centre of their faith. The tenets of these early
Gurus chimed in with the liberal sentiments of Akbar, and he treated
them kindly. Arjan was accused of helping Khusru, Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r's rebellious
son, and is alleged to have died after suffering cruel tortures.</p>

<p>Hitherto there had been little ill-will between monotheistic Sikhs and
Muhammadans. Henceforth there was ever-increasing enmity. The peasant
converts to the new creed had many scores against Turk officials to pay
off, while the new leader Hargovind (1606-1645), had the motive of
revenge. He was a Guru of a new type, a lover of horses and hawks, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
man of war. He kept up a bodyguard, and, when danger threatened, armed
followers flocked to his standard. The easy-going Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r (1605-1627)
on the whole treated him well. Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n (1627-1659) was more strict or
less prudent, and during his reign there were several collisions between
the imperial troops and the Guru's followers. Hargovind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> was succeeded
by his grandson, Har Rai (1645-1661). The new Guru was a man of peace.
Har Rai died in 1661, having nominated his younger son, Harkrishn, a
child of six, as his successor. His brother, R&aacute;m Rai, disputed his
claim, but Aurangzeb confirmed Harkrishn's appointment. He died of small
pox in 1664 and was succeeded by his uncle, Teg Bah&aacute;dur (1664-1675),
whose chief titles to fame are his execution in 1675, his prophecy of
the coming of the English, and the fact that he was the father of the
great tenth Guru, Govind. It is said that when in prison at Delhi he
gazed southwards one day in the direction of the Emperor's <i>zan&aacute;na</i>.
Charged with this impropriety, he replied: "I was looking in the
direction of the Europeans, who are coming to tear down thy <i>pardas</i> and
destroy thine empire."</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 60. Guru Govind Singh.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Guru Govind Singh.</b>&mdash;When Govind (1675-1708) succeeded his father,
Aurangzeb had already started on the course of persecution which fatally
weakened the pillars of Turkish rule. Govind grew up with a rooted
hatred of the Turks, and a determination to weld his followers into a
league of fighting men or <i>Kh&aacute;lsa</i> (Ar. <i>kh&aacute;lis</i> = pure), admission into
which was by the <i>pahul</i>, a form of military baptism. Sikhs were
henceforth to be <i>Singhs</i> (lions). They were forbidden to smoke, and
enjoined to wear the five k's, <i>kes</i>, <i>kangha</i>, <i>kripan</i>, <i>kachh</i>, and
<i>kara</i> (uncut hair, comb, sword, short drawers, and steel bracelet). He
established himself at Anandpur beyond the Hoshy&aacute;rpur Siw&aacute;liks. Much of
his life was spent in struggles with his neighbours, the R&aacute;jput Hill
R&aacute;jas, backed from time to time by detachments of imperial troops from
Sirhind. In 1705 two of his sons were killed fighting and two young
grandsons were executed at Sirhind. He himself took refuge to the south
of the Sutlej, but finally decided to obey a summons from Aurangzeb, and
was on the way to the Deccan when the old Emperor died. The Guru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> took
up his residence on the banks of the God&aacute;var&iacute;, and died there in 1708.</p>

<p><b>B&aacute;nda.</b>&mdash;Before his death he had converted the Hindu ascetic B&aacute;nda, and
sent him forth on a mission of revenge. B&aacute;nda defeated and slew the
governor of Sirhind, Waz&iacute;r Kh&aacute;n, and sacked the town. Doubtless he
dreamed of making himself Guru. But he was really little more than a
condottiere, and his orthodoxy was suspect. He was defeated and captured
in 1715 at Gurd&aacute;spur. Many of his followers were executed and he himself
was tortured to death at Delhi, where the members of an English mission
saw a ghastly procession of Sikh prisoners with 2000 heads carried on
poles. The blow was severe, and for a generation little was heard of the
Sikhs.</p>

<p><b>Invasions of N&aacute;dir Sh&aacute;h and Ahmad Sh&aacute;h.</b>&mdash;The central power was weak, and
a new era of invasions from the west began. N&aacute;dir Sh&aacute;h, the Turkman
shepherd, who had made himself master of Persia, advanced through the
Panj&aacute;b. Zakaria Kh&aacute;n, the governor of Lahore, submitted and the town was
saved from sack. A victory at Karn&aacute;l left the road to Delhi open, and in
March, 1738, the Persians occupied the capital. A shot fired at N&aacute;dir
Sh&aacute;h in the Ch&aacute;ndn&iacute; Chauk led to the nine hours' massacre, when the
Dar&iacute;ba ran with blood, and 100,000 citizens are said to have perished.
The Persians retired laden with booty, including the peacock throne and
the Kohinur diamond. The Sikhs harassed detachments of the army on its
homeward march. N&aacute;dir Sh&aacute;h was murdered nine years later, and his power
passed to the Afgh&aacute;n leader, the Dur&aacute;n&iacute; Ahmad Sh&aacute;h.</p>

<p>Between 1748 and 1767 this remarkable man, who could conquer but could
not keep, invaded India eight times. Lahore was occupied in 1748, but at
Sirhind the skill of M&iacute;r Mannu, called Mu&iacute;n ul Mulk, gave the advantage
to the Moghals. Ahmad Sh&aacute;h retreated, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> Mu&iacute;n ul Mulk was rewarded
with the governorship of the Panj&aacute;b. He was soon forced to cede to the
Afgh&aacute;n the revenue of four districts. His failure to fulfil his compact
led to a third invasion in 1752, and Mu&iacute;n ul Mulk, after a gallant
defence of Lahore, had to submit. In 1755-56 Ahmad Sh&aacute;h plundered Delhi
and then retired, leaving his son, Tim&uacute;r, to represent him at Lahore.
Meanwhile the Sikhs had been gathering strength. Then, as now, they
formed only a fraction of the population. But they were united by a
strong hatred of Muhammadan rule, and in the disorganized state of the
country even the loose organization described below made them
formidable. Owing to the weakness of the government the Panj&aacute;b became
dotted over with forts, built by local chiefs, who undoubtedly lived
largely by plunder. The spiritual organization under a Guru being gone,
there gradually grew up a political and military organization into
twelve <i>misls</i>, in which "a number of chiefs agreed, after a somewhat
democratic and equal fashion, to fight under the general orders of some
powerful leader" against the hated Muhammadans. The <i>misls</i> often fought
with one another for a change. In the third quarter of the eighteenth
century <i>Sard&aacute;r</i> Jassa Singh of Kap&uacute;rthala, head of the Ahluw&aacute;lia
<i>misl</i>, was the leading man among the Sikhs. Tim&uacute;r having defiled the
tank at Amritsar, Jassa Singh avenged the insult by occupying Lahore in
1756, and the Afgh&aacute;n prince withdrew across the Indus. Ad&iacute;na Beg, the
governor of the Jalandhar Do&aacute;b, called in the Mahrattas, who drove the
Sikhs out in 1758. Ahmad Sh&aacute;h's fifth invasion in 1761 was rendered
memorable by his great victory over the Mahratta confederacy at P&aacute;nipat.
When he returned to K&aacute;bul, the Sikhs besieged his governor, Z&iacute;n Kh&aacute;n, in
Sirhind. Next year Ahmad Sh&aacute;h returned, and repaid their audacity by a
crushing defeat near Barn&aacute;la.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>They soon rallied, and, in 1763, under Jassa Singh Ahluw&aacute;lia and R&aacute;ja
Ala Singh of Pati&aacute;la razed Sirhind to the ground. After the sack the
Sikh horsemen rode over the plains between Sirhind and Karn&aacute;l, each man
claiming for his own any village into which in passing he had thrown
some portion of his garments. This was the origin of the numerous petty
chiefships and confederacies of horsemen, which, along with the Phulkian
States, the British Government took under its protection in 1808. In
1764 the chiefs of the Bhang&iacute; <i>misl</i> occupied Lahore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<h3>HISTORY (<i>continued</i>). THE SIKH PERIOD, 1764-1849 A.D.</h3>


<p><b>Rise of Ranj&iacute;t Singh.</b>&mdash;The Bhang&iacute;s held Lahore with brief intervals for
25 years. In 1799, Ranj&iacute;t Singh, basing his claim on a grant from Sh&aacute;h
Zam&aacute;n, the grandson of Ahmad Sh&aacute;h, drove them out, and inaugurated the
remarkable career which ended with his death in 1839. When he took
Lahore the future Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja was only nineteen years of age. He was the
head of the Sukarchakia <i>misl</i>, which had its headquarters at
Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la. Mean in appearance, his face marked and one eye closed by
the ravages of smallpox, he was the one man of genius the Jat tribe has
produced. A splendid horseman, a bold leader, a cool thinker untroubled
with scruples, an unerring judge of character, he was bound to rise in
such times. He set himself to put down every Sikh rival and to profit by
the waning of the Dur&aacute;n&iacute; power to make himself master of their
possessions in the Panj&aacute;b. Pluck, patience, and guile broke down all
opposition among the M&aacute;njha Sikhs. The Sikh chiefs to the south of the
Sutlej were only saved from the same fate by throwing themselves in 1808
on the protection of the English, who six years earlier had occupied
Delhi, and by taking under their protection the blind old Emperor, Sh&aacute;h
&Aacute;lam, had virtually proclaimed themselves the paramount power in India.
For 44 years he had been only a piece in the game played by Mahrattas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Rohillas, and the English in alliance with the Naw&aacute;b Waz&iacute;r of Oudh.</p>

</div>


<p><b>British supremacy established in India.</b>&mdash;In the first years of the
nineteenth century the Marquess of Wellesley had made up his mind that
the time was ripe to grasp supreme power in India. The motive was
largely self-preservation. India was included in Napoleon's vast plans
for the overthrow of England, and Sindhia, with his army trained in
European methods of warfare by French officers, seemed a likely
confederate. Colonel Arthur Wellesley's hard-won battle at Assaye in
September, 1803, and Lord Lake's victories on the Hindan and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> at Lasw&aacute;r&iacute;
in the same year, decided the fate of India. Delhi was occupied, and
Daulat Rao Sindhia ceded to the company territory reaching from F&aacute;zilka
on the Sutlej to Delhi on the Jamna, and extending along that river
northwards to Karn&aacute;l and southwards to Mew&aacute;t. F&aacute;zilka and a large part
of Hiss&aacute;r then formed a wild desert tract called Bhatti&aacute;na, over which
no effective control was exercised till 1818. In 1832 "the Delhi
territory" became part of the North-West Provinces, from which it was
transferred to the Panj&aacute;b after the Mutiny.</p>

<p><b>Relations of Ranj&iacute;t Singh with English.</b>&mdash;In December, 1808, Ranj&iacute;t Singh
was warned that by the issue of the war with Sindhia the Cis-Sutlej
chiefs had come under British protection. The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja was within an ace
of declaring war, or let the world think so, but his statesmanlike
instincts got the better of mortified ambition, and in April, 1809, he
signed a treaty pledging himself to make no conquests south and east of
the Sutlej. The compact so reluctantly made was faithfully observed. In
1815, as the result of war with the Gurkhas, the R&aacute;jput hill states
lying to the south of the Sutlej came under British protection.</p>

<p><b>Extension of Sikh Kingdom in Panj&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;As early as 1806, when he reduced
Jhang, Ranj&iacute;t Singh began his encroachments on the possessions of the
Dur&aacute;n&iacute;s in the Panj&aacute;b. Next year, and again in 1810 and 1816, Mult&aacute;n was
attacked, but the strong fort was not taken till 1818, when the old
Naw&aacute;b, Muzaffar Kh&aacute;n, and five of his sons, fell fighting at the gate.
Kashm&iacute;r was first attacked in 1811 and finally annexed in 1819. Called
in by the great Katoch R&aacute;ja of K&aacute;ngra, Sans&aacute;r Chand, in 1809, to help
him against the Gurkhas, Ranj&iacute;t Singh duped both parties, and became
master of the famous fort. Many years later he annexed the whole of the
K&aacute;ngra hill states. By 1820 the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja was supreme from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> Sutlej to
the Indus, though his hold on Haz&aacute;ra was weak. Pesh&aacute;war became tributary
in 1823, but it was kept in subjection with much difficulty. Across the
Indus the position of the Sikhs was always precarious, and revenue was
only paid when an armed force could be sent to collect it. As late as
1837 the great Sikh leader, Har&iacute; Singh Nalwa, fell fighting with the
Afgh&aacute;ns at Jamr&uacute;d. The Barakzai, Dost Muhammad, had been the ruler of
K&aacute;bul since 1826. In 1838, when the English launched their ill-starred
expedition to restore Sh&aacute;h Shuja to his throne, Ranj&iacute;t Singh did not
refuse his help in the passage through the Panj&aacute;b. But he was worn out
by toils and excesses, and next year the weary lion of the Panj&aacute;b died.
He had known how to use men. He employed Jat blades and Brahman and
Muhammadan brains. Khatr&iacute;s put both at his service. The best of his
local governors was Diw&aacute;n S&aacute;wan Mal, who ruled the South-West Panj&aacute;b
with much profit to himself and to the people. After 1820 the three
Jammu brothers, R&aacute;jas Dhi&aacute;n Singh, Suchet Singh, and Gul&aacute;b Singh, had
great power.</p>

<p><b>Successors of Ranj&iacute;t Singh.</b>&mdash;From 1839 till 1846 an orgy of bloodshed
and intrigue went on in Lahore. Kharak Singh, the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja's son, died
in 1840, and on the same day occurred the death of his son Nao Nih&aacute;l
Singh, compassed probably by the Jammu R&aacute;jas. Sher Singh, and then the
child, Dal&iacute;p Singh, succeeded. In September, 1843, Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Sher Singh,
his son Part&aacute;b Singh, and R&aacute;ja Dhi&aacute;n Singh were shot by Aj&iacute;t Singh and
Lehna Singh of the great Sindhanw&aacute;lia house. The death of Dhi&aacute;n Singh
was avenged by his son, H&iacute;ra Singh, who proclaimed Dal&iacute;p Singh as
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja and made himself chief minister. When he in turn was killed
R&aacute;n&iacute; Jindan, the mother of Dal&iacute;p Singh, her brother Jow&aacute;hir Singh, and
her favourite, L&aacute;l Singh, took the reins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The First Sikh War and its results.</b>&mdash;In 1845 these intriguers, fearing
the <i>Kh&aacute;lsa</i> army which they could not control, yielded to its cry to be
led across the Sutlej in the hope that its strength would be broken in
its conflict with the Company's forces. The valour displayed by the Sikh
soldiery on the fields of Mudk&iacute;, Ferozesh&aacute;h (Pherushahr), and Sobr&aacute;on
was rendered useless by the treachery of its rulers, and Lahore was
occupied in February, 1846. By the treaty signed on 9th March, 1846, the
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja ceded the territories in the plains between the Sutlej and
Bi&aacute;s, and in the hills between the Bi&aacute;s and the Indus. Kashm&iacute;r and
Haz&aacute;ra were made over by the Company to R&aacute;ja Gul&aacute;b Singh for a payment
of 75 lakhs, but next year he induced the Lahore Darb&aacute;r to take over
Haz&aacute;ra and give him Jammu in exchange. After R&aacute;ja L&aacute;l Singh had been
banished for instigating Shekh Im&aacute;m ud din to resist the occupation of
Kashm&iacute;r by Gul&aacute;b Singh, an agreement was executed, in December, 1846,
between the Government and the chief Sikh <i>Sard&aacute;rs</i> by which a Council
of Regency was appointed to be controlled by a British Resident at
Lahore. The office was given to Henry Lawrence.</p>

<p><b>The Second Sikh War.</b>&mdash;These arrangements were destined to be
short-lived. Diw&aacute;n S&aacute;wan Mal's son, Mulr&aacute;j, mismanaged Mult&aacute;n and was
ordered to resign. In April, 1848, two English officers sent to instal
his Sikh successor were murdered. Herbert Edwardes, with the help of
Muhammadan tribesmen and Bah&aacute;walpur troops, shut up Mulr&aacute;j in Mult&aacute;n,
but the fort was too strong for the first British regular force, which
arrived in August, and it did not fall till January, 1849. During that
winter a formidable Sikh revolt against English domination broke out.
Its leader was <i>Sard&aacute;r</i> Chatar Singh, Governor of Haz&aacute;ra. The troops
sent by the <i>Darb&aacute;r</i> to Mult&aacute;n under Chatar Singh's son, Sher Singh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
marched northwards in September to join their co-religionists.</p>

<p>On the 13th of January, 1849, Lord Gough fought a very hardly contested
battle at Chilianw&aacute;la. If this was but a doubtful victory, that won six
weeks later at Gujr&aacute;t was decisive. On 12th March, 1849, the soldiers of
the <i>Kh&aacute;lsa</i> in proud dejection laid down their weapons at the feet of
the victor, and dispersed to their homes.</p>

<p><b>Annexation.</b>&mdash;The cause they represented was in no sense a national one.
The Sikhs were a small minority of the population, the bulk of the
people being Muhammadans, to whom the English came as deliverers. On the
30th of March, 1849, the proclamation annexing the Panj&aacute;b was read at
Lahore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<h3>HISTORY (<i>continued</i>). THE BRITISH PERIOD, 1849-1913</h3>


<p><b>Administrative Arrangements in Panj&aacute;b.</b>&mdash;Lord Dalhousie put the
government of the province under a Board of Administration consisting of
the two Lawrences, Henry and John, and Charles Mansel. The Board was
abolished in 1853 and its powers vested in a Chief Commissioner. A
Revenue or Financial Commissioner and a Judicial Commissioner were his
principal subordinates. John Lawrence, the first and only Chief
Commissioner of the Panj&aacute;b, became its first Lieutenant-Governor on the
1st of January, 1859. The raising of the Panj&aacute;b to the full rank of an
Indian province was the fitting reward of the great part which its
people and its officers, with their cool-headed and determined chief,
had played in the suppression of the Mutiny. The overthrow of the
<i>Kh&aacute;lsa</i> left the contending parties with the respect which strong men
feel for each other; the services of the Sikhs in 1857 healed their
wounded pride and removed all soreness.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 66. Sir John Lawrence.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Administration, 1849-1859.</b>&mdash;When John Lawrence laid down his office in
the end of February, 1859, ten years of work by himself and the able
officers drafted by Lord Dalhousie into the new province had established
order on a solid foundation. A strong administration suited to a manly
and headstrong people had been organised. In the greater part of the
province rights in land had been determined and recorded. The principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of a moderate assessment of the land revenue had been laid down and
partially carried out in practice. The policy of canal and railway
development, which was to have so great a future in the Panj&aacute;b, had been
definitely started. The province had been divided into nine divisions
containing 33 districts. The Divisional Commissioners were
superintendents of revenue and police<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> with power to try the gravest
criminal offences and to hear appeals in civil cases. The Deputy
Commissioner of districts had large civil, criminal, and fiscal powers.
A simple criminal and civil code was enforced. The peace of the frontier
was secured by a chain of fortified outposts watching the outlets from
the hills, behind which were the cantonments at the headquarters of the
districts linked together by a military road. The posts and the
cantonments except Pesh&aacute;war were garrisoned by the Frontier Force, a
splendid body of troops consisting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> ultimately of seven infantry and
five cavalry regiments, with some mule batteries. This force was till
1885 subject to the orders of the Lieutenant Governor. It never wanted
work, for before the Mutiny troops had to be employed seventeen times
against the independent tribesmen. East of the Indus order was secured
by the disarmament of the people, the maintenance, in addition to civil
police, of a strong body of military police, and the construction of
good roads. Just before Lawrence left the construction of the
Amritsar-Mult&aacute;n railway was begun, and a few weeks after his departure
the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal was opened.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Administration, 1859-1870.</b>&mdash;The next eleven years occupied by the
administrations of Sir Robert Montgomery and Sir Donald Macleod were a
quiet time in which results already achieved were consolidated. The
Penal Code was extended to the Panj&aacute;b in 1862, and a Chief Court with a
modest establishment of two judges in 1865 took the place of the
Judicial Commissioner. In the same year a Settlement Commissioner was
appointed to help the Financial Commissioner in the control of land
revenue settlements. Two severe famines marked the beginning and the
close of this period. Omitting the usual little frontier excitements, it
is necessary to mention the troublesome Ambela campaign in 1863 in the
country north of Pesh&aacute;war, which had for its object the breaking up of
the power of a nest of Hindust&aacute;n&iacute; fanatics, and the Black Mountain
expedition, in 1868, on the Haz&aacute;ra border, in which no fewer than 15,000
men were employed. Sir Henry Durand, who succeeded Sir Donald Macleod,
after seven months of office lost his life by an accident in the
beginning of 1871.</p>

<p><b>Administration, 1871-1882.</b>&mdash;The next eleven years divided between the
administrations of Sir Henry Davies (1871-1877) and Sir Robert Egerton
(1877-1882) produced more striking events. In 1872 a small body of
fanatics belonging to a Sikh sect known as K&uacute;kas or Shouters marched
from the Ludhi&aacute;na district and attacked the headquarters of the little
Muhammadan State of Malerkotla. They were repulsed and 68 men
surrendered to the Pati&aacute;la authorities. The Deputy Commissioner of
Ludhi&aacute;na blew 49 of them from the guns, and the rest were executed after
summary trial by the Commissioner. Such strong measures were not
approved by the Government, but it must be remembered that these madmen
had killed ten and wounded seventeen men, and that their lives were
justly forfeit. On the 1st of January,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> 1877, Queen Victoria's
assumption of the title of Empress of India (<i>Kaisar-i-Hind</i>) was
announced at a great <i>Darb&aacute;r</i> at Delhi. In 1877 Kashm&iacute;r, hitherto
controlled by the Lieutenant-Governor, was put directly under the
Government of India. The same year and the next the province was tried
by famine, and in 1878-80 it was the base from which our armies marched
on K&aacute;bul and Kandah&aacute;r, while its resources in camels were strained to
supply transport. Apart from this its interest in the war was very great
because it is the chief recruiting ground of the Indian army and its
chiefs sent contingents to help their suzerain. The first stage of the
war was closed by the treaty of Gandamak in May, 1879, by which Yak&uacute;b<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Kh&aacute;n surrendered any rights he possessed over Khaibar and the Kurram as
far as Shutargardan.</p>

<p><b>Administration, 1882-1892.</b>&mdash;During the Lieutenant-Governorships of Sir
Charles Aitchison (1882-1887) and Sir James Lyall (1887-1892) there was
little trouble on the western frontier. In 1891 the need had arisen of
making our power felt up to the Pam&iacute;rs. The setting up of a British
agency at Gilgit was opposed in 1891 by the fighting men of Hunza and
Nagar. Colonel Durand advanced rapidly with a small force and when a
determined assault reduced the strong fort of Nilt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> trouble was at an
end once and for all. Within the Panj&aacute;b the period was one of quiet
development. The Sirhind Canal was opened in 1882, and the weir at
Kh&aacute;nk&iacute; for the supply of the Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal was finished in 1892.
New railways were constructed. Lord Ripon's policy of Local
Self-government found a strong supporter in Sir Charles Aitchison, and
Acts were passed dealing with the constitution and powers of municipal
committees and district boards. In 1884 and 1885 a large measure of
reorganization was carried out. A separate staff of divisional,
district, and subordinate civil judges was appointed. The divisional
judges were also sessions judges. The ten commissioners were reduced to
six, and five of them were relieved of all criminal work by the sessions
judges. The Deputy Commissioner henceforth was a Revenue Collector and
District Magistrate with large powers in criminal cases. The revenue
administration was at the same time being improved by the reforms
embodied in the Panj&aacute;b Land Revenue and Tenancy Acts passed at the
beginning of Sir James Lyall's administration.</p>

<p><b>Administration, 1892-1902.</b>&mdash;The next two administrations, those of Sir
Dennis Fitzpatrick (1892-97) and Sir Mackworth Young (1897-1902) were
crowded with important events. Throughout the period the colonization of
the vast area of waste commanded by the Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal was carried
out, and the Lower Jhelam Canal was formally opened six months before
Sir Mackworth Young left. The province suffered from famine in 1896-97
and again in 1899-1900. In October, 1897, a worse enemy appeared in the
shape of plague, but its ravages were not very formidable till the end
of the period. The Panj&aacute;b was given a small nominated Legislative
Council in 1897, which speedily proved itself a valuable instrument for
dealing with much-needed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> provincial legislation. But the most important
Panj&aacute;b Act of the period, XIII of 1900, dealing with Land Alienation was
passed by the Viceroy's Legislative Council. In 1901 a Political Agent
was appointed as the intermediary between the Panj&aacute;b Government and the
Phulkian States. On the frontier the conclusion of the Durand Agreement
in 1893 might well have raised hopes of quiet times. But the reality was
otherwise. The establishment of a British officer at W&aacute;na to exercise
control over Southern Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n in 1894 was forcibly resisted by the
Mahs&uacute;d Waz&iacute;rs, and an expedition had to be sent into their country. The
Mehtar or Chief of Chitr&aacute;l, who was in receipt of a subsidy from the
British Government, died in 1892. A period of great confusion followed
fomented by the ambitions of Umra Kh&aacute;n of Jandol. Finally we recognised
as Mehtar the eldest son, who had come uppermost in the struggle, and
sent an English officer as British Agent to Chitr&aacute;l. Umra Kh&aacute;n got our
prot&eacute;g&eacute; murdered, and besieged the Agent in the Chitr&aacute;l fort. He
withdrew however on the approach of a small force from Gilgit.
Shuja-ul-Mulk was recognised as Mehtar. This little trouble occurred in
1895. Two years later a storm-cloud suddenly burst over the frontier,
such as we had never before experienced. It spread rapidly from the
Toch&iacute; to Sw&aacute;t, tribe after tribe rising and attacking our posts. It is
impossible to tell here the story of the military measures taken against
the different offending tribes. The most important was the campaign in
Tirah against the Orakzais and Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s, in which 30,000 men were engaged
for six months. In 1900 attacks on the peace of the border by the Mahs&uacute;d
Waz&iacute;rs had to be punished by a blockade, and in the cold weather of
1901-2 small columns harried the hill country to enforce their
submission. By this time the connection of the Panj&aacute;b Government with
frontier affairs, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> had gradually come to involve responsibility
with little real power, had ceased. On the 25th of October, 1901, the
North-West Frontier Province was constituted and Colonel (afterwards Sir
Harold) Deane became its first Chief Commissioner, an office which he
held till 1908, when he was succeeded by Major (now Sir George) Roos
Keppel.</p>

<p><b>Administration, 1902-1913.</b>&mdash;The last eleven years have embraced the
Lieutenant Governorship of Sir Charles Rivaz (1902-1907), the too brief
administration of Sir Denzil Ibbetson (1907-1908), and that of Sir Louis
Dane (1908-1913). Throughout the period plague has been a disturbing
factor, preventing entirely the growth of population which the rapid
development of the agricultural resources of the province would
otherwise have secured. It was among the causes stimulating the unrest
which came to a head in 1907. A terrible earthquake occurred in 1905.
Its centre was in K&aacute;ngra, where 20,000 persons perished under the ruins
of their houses. The colonization of the Crown waste on the Lower Jhelam
Canal was nearly finished during Sir Charles Rivaz's administration.
Before he left the Triple Canal Project, now approaching completion, had
been undertaken. Other measures of importance to the rural population
were the passing of the Co-operative Credit Societies' Act in 1903, and
the organization in 1905 of a provincial Agricultural Department. The
seditious movement which troubled Bengal had its echo in some parts of
the Panj&aacute;b in the end of 1906 and the spring of 1907. A bill dealing
with the rights and obligations of the Crown tenants in the new Canal
Colonies was at the time before the Local Legislature. Excitement
fomented from outside spread among the prosperous colonists on the Lower
Chen&aacute;b Canal. There was a disturbance in Lahore in connection with the
trial of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> newspaper editor, the ringleaders being students. When Sir
Denzil Ibbetson took the reins into his strong hands in March, 1907, the
position was somewhat critical. The disturbance at Lahore was followed
by a riot at R&aacute;walpind&iacute;. The two leading agitators were deported, a
measure which was amply justified by their reckless actions and which
had an immediate effect. Lord Minto decided to withhold his assent from
the Colony Bill, and it has recently been replaced by a measure which
has met with general acceptance. When Sir Denzil Ibbetson took office he
was already suffering from a mortal disease. In the following January he
gave up the unequal struggle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> and shortly afterwards died. Sir Louis
Dane became Lieutenant Governor in May, 1908. A striking feature of his
administration was the growth of co-operative credit societies or
village banks. At the Coronation <i>Darb&aacute;r</i> on 12th December, 1911, the
King-Emperor announced the transfer of the capital of India to Delhi. As
a necessary consequence the city and its suburbs were severed from the
province, with which they had been connected for 55 years. In 1913 Sir
Louis Dane was succeeded by Sir Michael O'Dwyer.</p>

<p><b>Hindu and Buddhist Remains.</b>&mdash;The scholar who ended his study of Indian
history with the close of the first millennium of the Christian era
would expect to find a fruitful field for the study of ancient monuments
of the Hindu faith in the plains of the Panj&aacute;b. He would look for a
great temple of the Sun God at Mult&aacute;n, and at places like Lahore and
K&aacute;ngra, Thanesar and Pihowa, for shrines rich with graven work outside
and with treasures of gold and precious stones within. But he would look
in vain. The Muhammadan invaders of the five centuries which elapsed
between Mahm&uacute;d of Ghazn&iacute; and the Moghal B&aacute;bar were above all things
idol-breakers, and their path was marked by the destruction and
spoliation of temples. Even those invaders who remained as conquerors
deemed it a pious work to build their mosques with the stones of ruined
fanes. The transformation, as in the case of the great Kuwwat ul Isl&aacute;m
mosque beside the Kutb Min&aacute;r, did not always involve the complete
obliteration of idolatrous emblems. K&aacute;ngra was not too remote to be
reached by invading armies, and the visitor to Nurpur on the road from
Path&aacute;nkot to Dharms&aacute;la can realize how magnificent some of the old Hindu
buildings were, and how utterly they were destroyed. The smaller
buildings to be found in the remoter parts of the hills escaped, and
there are characteristic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> groups of stone temples at Chamba and still
older shrines dating from the eighth century at Barmaur and Chitr&aacute;d&iacute; in
the same state. The ruins of the great temple of the Sun, built by
L&aacute;lit&aacute;ditya in the same period, at M&aacute;rtand<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> near Isl&aacute;m&aacute;b&aacute;d in the
Kashm&iacute;r State are very striking. The smaller, but far better preserved,
temple at Payer is probably of much later date. Round the pool of Kat&aacute;s,
one of &#350;iva's eyes, a great place of Hindu pilgrimage in the Salt
Range, there is little or nothing of antiquarian value, but there are
interesting remains at Malot in the same neighbourhood. It is possible
that when the mounds that mark the sites of ancient villages come to be
excavated valuable relics of the Hindu period will be brought to light.
The forces of nature or the violence of man have wiped out all traces of
the numerous Buddhist monasteries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> which the Chinese pilgrims found in
the Panj&aacute;b. Inscriptions of A&#351;oka? graven on rocks survive at
Sh&aacute;hb&aacute;zgarh&iacute; and Mansehra in the North-West Frontier Province. Two
pillars with inscriptions of the Missionary Emperor stand at Delhi. They
were brought from Topra near the Jamna in Amb&aacute;la and from Meerut by
Firoz Sh&aacute;h. The traveller by train from Jhelam to R&aacute;walpind&iacute; can see to
the west of the line at Manki&aacute;la a great <i>st&uacute;pa</i> raised to celebrate the
self-sacrifice of the Bodhisattva who gave his life to feed a starving
tigress. There is a ruined <i>st&uacute;pa</i> at Su&iacute; Vih&aacute;r in the Bah&aacute;walpur State.
The Chinese pilgrims described the largest of Indian <i>st&uacute;pas</i> built by
Kanishka near Pesh&aacute;war to enshrine precious relics of Gautama Buddha and
a great monastery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> beside it. Recent excavations have proved the truth
of the conjecture that the two mounds at Sh&aacute;hj&iacute; k&iacute; dher&iacute; covered the
remains of these buildings, and the six-sided crystal reliquary
containing three small fragments of bone has after long centuries been
disinterred and is now in the great pagoda at Rangoon. In the Lahore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
museum there is a rich collection of the sculptures recovered from the
Pesh&aacute;war Valley, the ancient Gandh&aacute;ra. They exhibit strong traces of
Greek influence. The best age of Gandh&aacute;ra sculpture was probably over
before the reign of Kanishka. The site of the famous town of T&aacute;xila is
now a protected area, and excavation there may yield a rich reward.</p>

<p><b>Muhammadan Architecture.</b>&mdash;The Muhammadan architecture of North-Western
India may be divided into three periods:</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 77. Kutb Min&aacute;r.</span>
</div>


<p>In the Path&aacute;n period the royal builders drew their inspiration from
Ghazn&iacute;, but their work was also much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> affected by Hindu influences for
two reasons. They used the materials of Hindu temples in constructing
their mosques and they employed masons imbued with the traditions of
Hindu art. The best specimens of this period are to be found in the
group of buildings in Old Delhi or <i>Kila' Rai Pithora</i>, close to
Mahraul&iacute; and eleven miles to the south of the present city. These
buildings are the magnificent <i>Kuwwat ul Isl&aacute;m</i> (Might of Islam) Mosque
(1191-1225), with its splendid tower, the <i>Kutb Min&aacute;r</i> (1200-1220), from
which the <i>mu'azzin</i> called the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> faithful to prayer, the tomb of the
Emperor Altamsh (1238), and the great gateway built in 1310 by Al&aacute; ud
d&iacute;n Khalj&iacute;. In the second period, named after the house that occupied
the imperial throne when it began, all traces of Hindu influence have
vanished, and the buildings display the austere and massive grandeur
suited to the faith of the desert prophet unalloyed by foreign elements.
This style in its beginning is best seen in the cyclopean ruins of
Tughlak&aacute;b&aacute;d and the tomb of the Emperor Tughlak Sh&aacute;h, and in some
mosques in and near Delhi. Its latest phase is represented by Sher
Sh&aacute;h's mosque in the Old Fort or <i>Pur&aacute;na Kila'</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> To some the simple
grandeur of this style will appeal more strongly than the splendid, but
at times almost effeminate, beauty of the third period. Noted examples
of Moghal architecture in the Panj&aacute;b are to be found in Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;ri's red
fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> palace and <i>Jama' Masjid</i> at New Delhi or Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n&aacute;b&aacute;d,
Hum&aacute;yun's tomb on the road from Delhi to Mahraul&iacute;, the fort palace, the
B&aacute;dsh&aacute;h&iacute; and Waz&iacute;r Kh&aacute;n's mosques, at Lahore, and Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r's mausoleum
at Sh&aacute;hdara. A very late building in this style is the tomb of Naw&aacute;b
Safdar Jang (1753) near Delhi. A further account of some of the most
famous Muhammadan buildings will be found in the paragraphs devoted to
the chief cities of the province. The architecture of the British period
scarcely deserves notice.</p>

<p><b>Coins.</b>&mdash;Among the most interesting of the archaeological remains are the
coins which are found in great abundance on the frontier and all over
the Panj&aacute;b. These take us back through the centuries to times before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the invasion of India by Alexander, and for the obscure period
intervening between the Greek occupation of the Frontier and the
Muhammadan conquest, they are our main source of history. The most
ancient of the Indian monetary issues are the so-called punch-marked
coins, some of which were undoubtedly in existence before the Greek
invasion. Alexander himself left no permanent traces of his progress
through the Panj&aacute;b and Sindh, but about the year 200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, Greeks from
Bactria, an outlying province of the Seleukidan Empire, once more
appeared on the Indian Frontier, which they effectively occupied for
more than a century. They struck the well-known Graeco-Bactrian coins;
the most famous of the Indo-Greek princes were Apollodotos and Menander.
Towards the close of this dynasty, parts of Sindh and Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n were
conquered by S&aacute;ka Scythians from Central Asia. They struck what are
termed the Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian coins bearing names in
legible Greek legends&mdash;Manes, Azes, Azilises, Gondophares, Abdagases.
Both Greeks and S&aacute;kas were overthrown by the Kush&aacute;ns. The extensive gold
and copper Kush&aacute;n currency, with inscriptions in the Greek script,
contains the names of Kadphises, Kanishka, Huvishka, and others. In
addition to the coins of these foreign dynasties, there are the purely
Indian currencies, e.g. the coins of T&aacute;xila, and those bearing the names
of such tribes as the Odumbaras, Kunindas, and Yaudheyas. The White Huns
overthrew the Kush&aacute;n Empire in the fifth century. After their own fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
in the sixth century, there are more and more debased types of coinage
such as the ubiquitous <i>Gadhiya paisa</i>, a degraded Sassanian type. In
the ninth century we again meet with coins bearing distinct names, the
"bull and horseman" currency of the Hindu kings of K&aacute;bul. We have now
reached the beginning of the Muhammadan rule in India. Muhammad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> bin
S&aacute;m was the founder of the first Path&aacute;n dynasty of Delhi, and was
succeeded by a long line of Sult&aacute;ns. The Path&aacute;n and Moghal coins bear
Arabic and Persian legends. There were mints at Lahore, Mult&aacute;n,
H&aacute;fiz&aacute;b&aacute;d, Kalanaur, Deraj&aacute;t, Pesh&aacute;war, Sr&iacute;nagar and Jammu. An issue of
coins peculiar to the Panj&aacute;b is that of the Sikhs. Their coin legends,
partly Persian, partly Panj&aacute;b&iacute;, are written in the Persian and Gurm&uacute;kh&iacute;
scripts. Amongst Sikh mints were Amritsar, Lahore, Mult&aacute;n, Dera,
Anandgarh, Jhang, and Kashm&iacute;r.</p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION&mdash;GENERAL</h3>


<p><b>Panj&aacute;b Districts.</b>&mdash;The administrative unit in the Panj&aacute;b is the district
in charge of a Deputy Commissioner. The districts are divided into
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, each on the average containing four, and are grouped together
in divisions managed by Commissioners. There are 28 districts and five
divisions. An ordinary Panj&aacute;b district has an area of 2000 to 3000
square miles and contains from 1000 to 2000 village estates. Devon, the
third in size of the English counties, is about equal to an average
Panj&aacute;b district.</p>

<p><b>Branches of Administration.</b>&mdash;The provincial governments of India are
organized in three branches, Executive, Judicial, and Revenue, and a
number of special departments, such as Forests and Irrigation. Under
"Judicial" there are two subdivisions, civil and criminal. The tendency
at first is for powers in all three branches to be concentrated in the
hands of single individuals, development tends to specialization, but it
is a matter of controversy how far the separation of executive and
magisterial functions can be carried without jeopardy to the common
weal.</p>

<p><b>The Lieutenant Governor.</b>&mdash;At the head of the whole administration is the
Lieutenant Governor, who holds office for five years. He has a strong
Secretariat to help in the dispatch of business. The experiment of
governing the Panj&aacute;b by a Board was speedily given up, and for sixty
years it has enjoyed the advantage of one man government, the Lieutenant
Governor controlling all subordinate authorities and being himself only
controlled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> by the Governor General in Council. The independence of the
Courts in the exercise of judicial functions is of course safeguarded.</p>

<p><b>Official hierarchy.</b>&mdash;The following is a list of the official hierarchy
in the different branches of the administration:</p>



<div class='centered'>

<p>The letters in brackets indicate the classes of functions which the

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tahs&iacute;ld&aacute;rs and Assistant and Extra Assistant Commissioners.</b>&mdash;Thus the
chain of executive authority runs down to the <i>tahs&iacute;ld&aacute;r's</i> assistant or
<i>n&aacute;ib</i> through the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, the
<i>tahs&iacute;ld&aacute;r</i> being directly responsible to the latter. The Assistant and
Extra Assistant Commissioners are the Deputy Commissioner's Assistants
at headquarters, and as such are invested with powers in all branches.
The <i>tahs&iacute;ld&aacute;r</i>, a very important functionary, is in charge of a
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. He is linked on to the village estates by a double chain, one
official consisting of the <i>kanungos</i> and the <i>patw&aacute;ris</i> or village
accountants whom they supervise, the other non-official consisting of
the village headmen and the <i>zaild&aacute;rs</i>, each of whom is the intermediary
between the revenue and police staffs and the villages.</p>

<p><b>Subdivisional Officers.</b>&mdash;In some heavy districts one or more <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>
are formed into a subdivision and put in charge of a resident Assistant
or Extra Assistant Commissioner, exercising such independent authority
as the Deputy Commissioner thinks fit to entrust to him.</p>

<p><b>The Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants.</b>&mdash;As the officer responsible
for the maintenance of order the Deputy Commissioner is District
Magistrate and has large powers both for the prevention and punishment
of crime. The District Superintendent is his Assistant in police
matters. The Civil Surgeon is also under his control, and he has an
Indian District Inspector of Schools to assist him in educational
business. The Deputy Commissioner is subject to the control of the
Divisional Commissioner.</p>

<p><b>Financial Commissioners.</b>&mdash;In all matters connected with land, excise,
and income tax administration the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner
are subject to the control of the Financial Commissioners, who are also
the final appellate authority in revenue cases. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> chief district
revenue officer the Deputy Commissioner's proper title is "Collector," a
term which indicates his responsibility for the realization of all
Government revenues. In districts which are canal irrigated the amount
is in some cases very large.</p>

<p><b>Settlement Officers, etc.</b>&mdash;With the periodical revisions of the land
revenue assessment the Deputy Commissioner has no direct concern. That
very responsible duty is done by a special staff of Settlement Officers,
selected chiefly from among the Assistant Commissioners and working
under the Commissioners and Financial Commissioners. The Director of
Land Records, the Registrar of Co-operative Credit Societies, and in
some branches of his work the Director of Agriculture and Industries,
are controlled by the Financial Commissioners.</p>

<p><b>The Chief Court.</b>&mdash;It must be admitted that Panj&aacute;b&iacute;s are very litigious
and that in some tracts they are extremely vindictive and reckless of
human life. The volume of litigation is swollen by the fact that the
country is one of small-holders subject as regards inheritance and other
matters to an uncodified customary law, which may vary from tribe to
tribe and tract to tract. A suit is to the Panj&aacute;b&iacute; a rubber, the last
game of which he will play in Lahore, if the law permits. It is not
therefore extraordinary that the Chief Court constituted in 1865 with
two judges has now five, and that even this number has in the past
proved insufficient. In the same way the cadre of divisional and
sessions judges had in 1909 to be raised from 12 to 16.</p>

<p><b>Administration of N. W. F. Province.</b>&mdash;In the N. W. F. Province no
Commissioner is interposed between the district officers and the Chief
Commissioner, under whom the Revenue Commissioner and the Judicial
Commissioner occupy pretty much the position of the Financial
Commissioners and the Chief Court in the Panj&aacute;b.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Departments.</b>&mdash;The principal departments are the Railway, Post Office,
Telegraphs, and Accounts, under the Government of India, and Irrigation,
Roads and Buildings, Forests, Police, Medical, and Education, under the
Lieutenant Governor. In matters affecting the rural population, as a
great part of the business of the Forest Department must do, the
Conservator of Forests is subject to the control of the Financial
Commissioners, whose relations with the Irrigation Department are also
very intimate.</p>

<p><b>Legislative Council.</b>&mdash;From 1897 to 1909 the Panj&aacute;b had a local
Legislative Council of nine nominated members, which passed a number of
useful Acts. Under 9 Edward VII, cap. 4, an enlarged council with
increased powers has been constituted. It consists of 24 members of whom
eight are elected, one by the University, one by the Chamber of
Commerce, three by groups of Municipal and cantonment committees, and
three by groups of district boards. The other sixteen members are
nominated by the Lieutenant Governor, and at least six of them must be
persons not in Government service. The right of interpellation has been
given, and also some share in shaping the financial arrangements
embodied in the annual budget.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION&mdash;LOCAL</h3>


<p><b>Municipalities.</b>&mdash;It is matter for reflection that, while the effect of
British administration has been to weaken self-government in villages,
half a century of effort has failed to make it a living thing in towns
and districts. The machinery exists, but outside a few towns the result
is poor. The attempt was made on too large a scale, municipal
institutions being bestowed on places which were no more than villages
with a <i>baz&aacute;r</i>. This has been partially corrected of late years. A new
official entity, the "notified area," has been invented to suit the
requirements of such places. While there were in 1904 139 municipalities
and 48 notified areas, in 1911-12 the figures were 107 and 104
respectively. Even in the latter year 32 of the municipalities had
incomes not exceeding &pound;1000 (Rs. 15,000). The total income of the 104
towns was Rs. 71,41,000 (&pound;476,000), of which Rs. 44,90,000 (&pound;300,000)
were derived from taxation. Nearly 90 p.c. of the taxation was drawn
from octroi, a hardy plant which has survived much economic criticism.
The expenditure was Rs. 69,09,000 (&pound;461,000), of which Rs. 40,32,000
(&pound;269,000) fall under the head of "Public Health and Convenience." The
incidence of taxation was Rs. 2.6 or a little over three shillings a
head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>District Boards.</b>&mdash;The district boards can at present in practice only be
treated as consultative bodies, and well handled can in that capacity
play a useful r&ocirc;le. Their income is mainly derived from the local rate,
a surcharge of one-twelfth on the land revenue. In 1911-12 the income
was Rs. 53,74,000 (&pound;358,000) and the expenditure Rs. 54,44,500
(&pound;363,000). The local rate contributed 51 p.c. and contributions from
Government 23 p.c. of the former figure. Public works took up 41 and
Education about 20 p.c. of the expenditure.</p>

<p><b>Elections.</b>&mdash;Some of the seats in most of the municipalities and boards
are filled by election when any one can be induced to vote. Public
spirit is lacking and, as a rule, except when party or sectarian spirit
is rampant, the franchise is regarded with indifference.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE</h3>


<p><b>Financial Relations with Government of India.</b>&mdash;Local governments
exercise their financial powers in strict subordination to the
Government of India, which alone can borrow, and which requires the
submission for its sanction of the annual provincial budgets. To ensure
a reasonable amount of decentralization the Supreme Government has made
financial contracts with the provinces under which they receive definite
shares of the receipts, and are responsible for definite shares of the
expenditure, under particular heads. The existing contract dates only
from 1911-12 (see Table V).</p>

<p><b>Income and Expenditure.</b>&mdash;Excluding income from railways, post offices,
telegraphs, salt, and sales of excise opium, which are wholly imperial,
the revenue of the Panj&aacute;b in 1911-12 was &pound;5,057,000 (Rs. 758,56,000), of
which the provincial share was &pound;2,662,200 (Rs. 399,33,000), to which
have to be added &pound;251,800 (Rs. 37,77,000) on account of assignments made
by the Government of India to the province. This brought up the total to
&pound;2,914,000 (Rs. 437,10,000). The expenditure was &pound;2,691,933 (Rs.
403,79,000). This does not include &pound;983,000 spent from loan funds on
irrigation works, chiefly the great Triple Project. The large
expenditure on railways is imperial. Of the gross income more than
three-fourths is derived from the land (Land Revenue, 46 p.c.,
Irrigation, chiefly canal water rates, 29 p.c., and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> Forests, 1&frac34;
p.c.). The balance consists of Excise 8&frac12; p.c., Stamps, 7 p.c., Income
Tax over 2 p.c., and other heads 5&frac34; p.c.</p>

<p><b>Land Revenue.</b>&mdash;Certain items are included under the Land Revenue head
which are no part of the assessment of the land. The real land revenue
of the Panj&aacute;b is about &pound;2,000,000 and falls roughly at the rate of
eighteen pence per cultivated acre (Table II). It is not a land tax, but
an extremely moderate quit rent. In India the ruler has always taken a
share of the produce of the land from the persons in whom he recognised
a permanent right to occupy it or arrange for its tillage. The title of
the R&aacute;ja to his share and the right of the occupier to hold the land he
tilled and pass it on to his children both formed part of the customary
law of the country. Under Indian rule the R&aacute;ja's share was often
collected in kind, and the proportion of the crop taken left the tiller
of the soil little or nothing beyond what was needed for the bare
support of himself and his family. What the British Government did was
to commute the share in kind into a cash demand and gradually to limit
its amount to a reasonable figure. The need of moderation was not
learned without painful experience, but the Panj&aacute;b was fortunate in this
that, except as regards the Delhi territory, the lesson had been learned
and a reasonable system evolved in the United Provinces before the
officers it sent to the Panj&aacute;b began the regular assessments of the
districts of the new province. A land revenue settlement is usually made
for a term of 20 or 30 years. Since 1860 the limit of the government
demand has been fixed at one-half of the rental, but this figure is very
rarely approached in practice. Between a quarter and a third would be
nearer the mark. A large part of the land is tilled by the owners, and
the rent of the whole has to be calculated from the data for the part,
often not more than a third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> or two-fifths of the whole, cultivated by
tenants at will. The calculation is complicated by the fact that kind
rents consisting of a share of the crop are in most places commoner than
cash rents and are increasing in favour. The determination of the cash
value of the rent where the crop is shared is a very difficult task.
There is a large margin for error, but there can be no doubt that the
net result has almost always been undervaluation. It is probable that
the share of the produce of the fields which the land revenue absorbs
rarely exceeds one-seventh and is more often one-tenth or less. A clear
proof of the general moderation of Panj&aacute;b assessments is furnished by
the fact that in the three years ending 1910-11 the recorded prices in
sales amounted to more than Rs. 125 per rupee of land revenue of the
land sold, which may be taken as implying a belief on the part of
purchasers that the landlord's rent is not double, but five or six times
the land revenue assessment, for a man would hardly pay Rs. 125 unless
he expected to get at least six or seven rupees annual profit.</p>

<p><b>Fluctuating Assessments.</b>&mdash;The old native plan of taking a share of the
crop, though it offered great opportunity for dishonesty on both sides,
had at least the merit of roughly adjusting the demand to the character
of the seasons. It was slowly realized that there were parts of the
province where the harvests were so precarious that even a very moderate
fixed cash assessment was unsuitable. Various systems of fluctuating
cash assessment have therefore been introduced, and one-fourth of the
total demand is now of this character, the proportion having been
greatly increased by the adoption of the fluctuating principle in the
new canal colonies.</p>

<p><b>Suspensions and Remissions.</b>&mdash;Where fixity is retained the strain in bad
seasons is lessened by a free use of suspensions, and, if the amounts of
which the collection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> has been deferred accumulate owing to a succession
of bad seasons, resort is had to remission.</p>

<p><b>Irrigation Income and Expenditure.</b>&mdash;In a normal year in the Panj&aacute;b over
one-fourth of the total crops is matured by the help of Government
Canals, and this proportion will soon be largely increased. In 1911-12
the income from canals amounted to &pound;1,474,000, and the working expenses
to &pound;984,000, leaving a surplus of &pound;490,000. Nearly the whole of the
income is derived from water rates, which represent the price paid by
the cultivator for irrigation provided by State expenditure. The rates
vary for different crops and on different canals. The average incidence
may be roughly put at Rs. 4 or a little over five shillings per acre. In
calculating the profit on canals allowance is made for land revenue
dependent on irrigation, amounting to nearly &pound;400,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Districts and Divisions.</b>&mdash;The Panj&aacute;b now consists of 28 districts
grouped in five divisions. In descriptions of districts and states
boundaries, railways, and roads, which appear on the face of the inset
maps, are omitted. Details regarding cultivation and crops will be found
in Tables II, III and IV, and information as to places of note in
Chapter <span class="smcap">XXX</span>. The revenue figures of Panj&aacute;b districts in this chapter
relate to the year 1911-12.</p>

<p><b>Delhi Enclave.</b>&mdash;On the transfer of the capital of India to Delhi part of
the area of the old district of that name comprising 337 estates was
removed from the jurisdiction of the Panj&aacute;b Government and brought under
the immediate authority of the Government of India (Act No. XIII of
1912). The remainder of the district was divided between Rohtak and
Gurg&aacute;on, and the headquarters of the Delhi division were transferred to
Amb&aacute;la.</p>

<p>The area of the new province is only 528 square miles, and the
population including that of the City is estimated at 396,997. The
cultivated area is 340 square miles, more than half of which is
cultivated by the owners themselves. The principal agricultural tribe is
the Hindu J&aacute;ts, who are hard-working and thrifty peasant farmers. The
land revenue is Rs. 4,00,203 (&pound;26,680). The above figures only relate to
the part of the enclave formerly included in the Panj&aacute;b<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The head of

<p><b>Hiss&aacute;r District.</b>&mdash;Hiss&aacute;r is the south-western district
of the division and has a long common
boundary with Bikaner. It is divided into
five <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Hiss&aacute;r, H&aacute;nsi, Bhiw&aacute;n&iacute;, Fateh&aacute;b&aacute;d,
and Sirsa. There are four natural
divisions, N&aacute;l&iacute;, B&aacute;gar, Roh&iacute;, and Hari&aacute;na.
The overflow of the Ghagar, which runs through the
north of the district, has transformed the lands on either
bank into hard intractable clay, which yields nothing to
the husbandman without copious floods. This is the N&aacute;l&iacute;.
The B&aacute;gar is a region of rolling sand stretching along the
Bikaner border from Sirsa to Bhiw&aacute;n&iacute;. In Sirsa to the east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of the B&aacute;gar is a plain of very light reddish loam known as
the Roh&iacute;, partly watered by the Sirhind Canal. South of
the Ghagar the loam in the east of the district is firmer,
and well adapted to irrigation, which much of it obtains
from branches of the Western Jamna Canal. This tract
is known as Hari&aacute;na, and has given its name to a famous
breed of cattle. The Government cattle farm at Hiss&aacute;r
covers an area of 65 square miles. North of the Fateh&aacute;b&aacute;d
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i> and surrounded by villages belonging to the
Phulkian States is an island of British territory called
Budhl&aacute;da. It belongs to the Jangal Des, and has the
characteristic drought-resisting sandy loam and sand of
that tract. Much of Budhl&aacute;da is watered by the Sirhind
Canal. Of the total area of the district only about
9 p.c. is irrigated. The water level is so far from the
surface that well irrigation is usually impossible, and
the source of irrigation is canals.</p>

<p>Hiss&aacute;r suffered severely from the disorders which
followed on the collapse of the Moghal Empire and its
ruin was consummated by the terrible famine of 1783.
The starving people died or fled and for years the country
lay desolate. It passed into the hands of the British 20
years later, but for another 20 years our hold on this
outlying territory was loose and ineffective. In 1857
the troops at H&aacute;nsi, Hiss&aacute;r, and Sirsa rose and killed all
the Europeans who fell into their hands. The Muhammadan
tribes followed their example, and for a time
British authority ceased to exist. The district was
part of the Delhi territory transferred to the Panj&aacute;b in
1858.</p>

<p>The rainfall is scanty, averaging 15 inches, and extremely
capricious. No other district suffers so much from
famine as Hiss&aacute;r. The crops are extraordinarily insecure,
with a large surplus in a good season and practically
nothing when the rains fail badly. They consist mainly
of the cheap pulses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> and millets. With such fluctuating
harvests it is impossible to collect the revenues with any
regularity, and large sums have to be suspended in bad
seasons.</p>

<p>Such industries as exist are mostly in H&aacute;nsi and
Bhiw&aacute;n&iacute;, where there are mills for ginning and pressing
cotton. Cotton cloths tastefully embroidered with silk,
known as <i>phulk&aacute;r&iacute;s</i>, are a well-known local product.</p>

<p><b>Rohtak</b>&mdash;became a British possession in 1803, but it
was not till after the Mutiny that it was
brought wholly under direct British administration.
The old district consisted of the
three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Rohtak, Goh&aacute;na, and Jhajar,
but on the breaking up of the Delhi district the Sonepat
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i> was added.</p>

<p>Rohtak is practically a purely agricultural tract with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
large villages, but no towns of any importance. By far
the most important agricultural tribe is the Hindu J&aacute;ts.
They are strong-bodied sturdy farmers, who keep fine oxen
and splendid buffaloes, and live in large and well organized
village communities. 37 p.c. of the cultivation is protected
by canal and well irrigation, the former being by
far the more important. The district consists mainly of
a plain of good loam soil. There have been great canal
extensions in this plain, which under irrigation is very
fertile, yielding excellent wheat, cotton, and cane.
There is a rich belt of well irrigation in the Jamna valley,
and in the south of the district there are parts where
wells can be profitably worked. Belts of uneven sandy
land are found especially in the west and south. The
dry cultivation is most precarious, for the rainfall is
extremely variable. In the old district it averages 20
inches. But averages in a tract like Rohtak mean very
little. The chief crops are the two millets and gram.</p>

<p><b>Gurg&aacute;on</b> contains six <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Rew&aacute;r&iacute;, Gurg&aacute;on, Nuh,
Firozpur, Palwal, and Ballabgarh. The
southern part of the district projects into
R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, and in its physical and racial
characteristics really belongs to that region.</p>

<p>Rew&aacute;r&iacute; is the only town of any importance. It has
a large trade with R&aacute;jput&aacute;na. Apart from this the
interests of the district are agricultural. In Gurg&aacute;on
the Jamna valley is for the most part narrow and very
poor. The plain above it in the Palwal <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> has a fertile
loam soil and is irrigated by the Agra Canal. The Hindu
J&aacute;ts of this part of the district are good cultivators.
The rest of Gurg&aacute;on consists mostly of sand and sandy
loam and low bare hills. In Rew&aacute;r&iacute; the skill and industry
of the Hindu Ah&iacute;rs have produced wonderful results
considering that many of the wells are salt and much of
the land very sandy. The lazy and thriftless Meos of
the southern part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> of the district are a great contrast to
the Ah&iacute;rs. They are Muhammadans.</p>

<p>About a quarter of the area is protected by irrigation
from wells, the Agra Canal, and embankments or "<i>bands</i>,"
which catch and hold up the hill drainages. Owing to
the depth and saltness of many of the wells the cultivation
dependent on them is far from secure, and the "<i>band</i>"
irrigation is most precarious. The large dry area is
subject to extensive and complete crop failures. The
average rainfall over a series of years is 24 inches, but its
irregularities from year to year are extreme. The district
is a poor one, and for its resources bears the heaviest
assessment in the Panj&aacute;b. It requires the most careful
revenue management. There are brine wells at Sult&aacute;npur,
but the demand for the salt extracted is now very small.</p>

<p>The district falls broadly into two divisions, the
boundary between them being the southern limit of the
floods of the Sarust&iacute; in years of heavy rainfall. The
marked features of the northern division is the effect which
the floods of torrents of intermittent flow, the Sarust&iacute;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
M&aacute;rkanda, Umla, and Ghagar have on agriculture. Some
tracts are included like the Andarw&aacute;r and the outlying
villages of the Pow&aacute;dh<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in Kaithal which are fortunately
unaffected by inundation, and have good well irrigation.
The country between the Umla and M&aacute;rkanda in Thanesar
gets rich silt deposits and is generally fertile. The
Kaithal Nail&iacute; is the tract affected by the overflow of the
Sarust&iacute;, Umla, and Ghagar. It is a wretched fever-stricken
region where a short lived race of weakly people
reap precarious harvests. The southern division is on
the whole a much better country. It includes the whole
of Karn&aacute;l and P&aacute;nipat, the south of Kaithal, and a
small tract in the extreme east of the Thanesar <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>.
North of Karn&aacute;l the Jamna valley or Kh&aacute;dir is unhealthy
and has in many parts a poor soil. South of Karn&aacute;l it
is much better in every respect. Above the Kh&aacute;dir is
the B&aacute;ngar, a plain of good loam. North of Karn&aacute;l
its cultivation is protected by wells and the people are
in fair circumstances. South of that town it is watered
by the Western Jamna Canal. Another slight rise brings
one to the Nardak of the Karn&aacute;l and Kaithal <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>.
Till the excavation of the Sirsa branch of the Western
Jamna Canal and of the Nardak Distributary much of
the Nardak was covered with <i>dh&aacute;k</i> jangal, and the
cultivation was of the most precarious nature, for in this
part of the district the rainfall is both scanty and
capricious, and well cultivation is only possible in the
north. The introduction of canal irrigation has effected an
enormous change. Wheat and gram are the great crops.</p>

<p>Historically Karn&aacute;l is one of the most interesting
districts. The Nardak is the scene of the great struggle
celebrated in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata. The district contains
the holy city of Thanesar, once the capital of a great
Hindu kingdom. It has found climate a more potent
instrument of ruin than the sword of Mahm&uacute;d of Ghazn&iacute;,
who sacked it in 1014. It still on the occasion of Eclipse
fairs attracts enormous crowds of pilgrims. Pihowa is
another very sacred place. Nar&aacute;ina, a few miles to the
north-west of Karn&aacute;l, was the scene of two famous
fights<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and three times, in 1526, 1556, and 1761, the
fate of India was decided at P&aacute;nipat.</p>

<p>The only town of importance is Amb&aacute;la. Jag&aacute;dhr&iacute;
is a busy little place now connected through private
enterprise by a light railway with the N. W. Railway.
The district consists of two parts almost severed from one
another physically and wholly different as regards people,
language, and agricultural prosperity. The R&uacute;par subdivision
in the north-west beyond the Ghagar has a fertile
soil, and, except in the N&aacute;l&iacute;, as the tract flooded by the
Ghagar is called, a vigorous J&aacute;t peasantry, whose native
tongue is Panj&aacute;b&iacute;. The three south-eastern <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>,
Amb&aacute;la,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> Nar&aacute;ingarh, and Jag&aacute;dhr&iacute;, are weaker in every
respect. The loam is often quite good, but interspersed
with it are tracts of stubborn clay largely put under
precarious rice crops. The J&aacute;ts are not nearly so good
as those of R&uacute;par, and R&aacute;jputs, who are mostly Musulm&aacute;ns,
own a large number of estates.</p>

<p>Lahul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> Spit&iacute;, Kulu, and Sar&aacute;j form a subdivision in
charge of an Assistant Commissioner. The people of
K&aacute;ngra are Hindus. Isl&aacute;m never penetrated into these
hills as a religion, though the R&aacute;jput R&aacute;jas of K&aacute;ngra
became loyal subjects of the Moghal Emperors. In its
last days Ranj&iacute;t Singh called in as an ally against the
Gurkhas remained as a hated ruler. The country was
ceded to the British Government in 1846. The R&aacute;jas
were chagrined that we did not restore to them their
royal authority, but only awarded them the status of
<i>jag&iacute;rd&aacute;rs</i>. An outbreak, which was easily suppressed,
occurred in 1848. Since then K&aacute;ngra has enjoyed 65
years of peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> A Gurkha regiment is stationed at the
district headquarters at Dharms&aacute;la. The cultivation
ranges from the rich maize and rice fields of Kulu and
K&aacute;ngra to the poor buckwheat and <i>kulath</i> on mountain
slopes. Rice is irrigated by means of <i>kuhls</i>, ingeniously
constructed channels to lead the water of the torrents on
to the fields.</p>

<p><b>Spit&iacute; and Lahul.</b>&mdash;Spit&iacute;, or rather Pit&iacute;, is a country of
great rugged mountains, whose bare red and yellow
rocks rise into crests of everlasting snow showing clear
under a cloudless blue sky. There is no rain, but in winter
the snowfall is heavy. The highest of the mountains
exceeds 23,000 feet. Pit&iacute; is drained by the river of the
same name, which after passing through Bashahr falls I
into the Sutlej at an elevation of 11,000 feet. Of the few
villages several stand at a height of from 13,000 to 14,000
feet. The route to Pit&iacute; from Kulu passes over the Hamtu
Pass (14,200 feet) and the great Shigr&iacute; glacier. The people
are Buddhists. They are governed by their hereditary
ruler or Nono assisted by five elders, the Assistant
Commissioner exercising a general supervision. Indian
laws do not apply to the sparse population of this remote
canton, which has a special regulation of its own. Lahul
lies to the west of Pit&iacute;, from which it is separated by a
lofty range. It is entered from Kulu by the Rotang
Pass (13,000 feet) and the road from it to Lad&aacute;kh passes
over the Baral&aacute;cha (16,350 feet). The whole country is
under snow from December to April, but there is very
little rain. The two streams, the Chandra and Bh&aacute;ga,
which unite to form the Chen&aacute;b, flow through Lahul and
the few villages are situated at a height of 10,000 feet in
their elevated valleys. The people are Buddhists. In
summer the population is increased by "Gadd&iacute;" shepherds
from K&aacute;ngra, who drive lean flocks in the beginning of
June over the Rotang and take them back from the
Alpine pastures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> in the middle of September fat and well

<p><b>Kulu and Sar&aacute;j.</b>&mdash;The Kulu Valley, set in a mountain
frame and with the Bi&aacute;s, here a highland stream, running
through the heart of it, is one of the fairest parts of the
Panj&aacute;b Him&aacute;laya. Man&aacute;l&iacute;, at the top of the Valley on
the road to the Rotang, is a very beautiful spot. Kulu
is connected with K&aacute;ngra through Mand&iacute; by the Babbu
and Dulch&iacute; passes. The latter is generally open the whole
year round. The headquarters are at Sult&aacute;npur, but
the Assistant Commissioner lives at Nagar. In Kulu
the cultivation is often valuable and the people are well
off. The climate is good and excellent apples and pears
are grown by European settlers. Inner and outer Sar&aacute;j
are connected by the Jalaori Pass on the watershed of the
Sutlej and Bi&aacute;s. Sar&aacute;j is a much rougher and poorer
country than Kulu. There are good <i>deod&aacute;r</i> forests in
the Kulu subdivision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> In 1911 the population of Kulu,
Sar&aacute;j, Lahul, and Pit&iacute;, numbered 124,803. The Kulu
people are a simple folk in whose primitive religion local
godlings of brass each with his little strip of territory take
the place of the Brahmanic gods. It is a quaint sight to
see their ministers carrying them on litters to the fair at
Sult&aacute;npur, where they all pay their respects to a little
silver god known as Raghun&aacute;thj&iacute;, who is in a way their
suzerain.</p>

<p>K&aacute;ngra proper is bounded on the north by the lofty
wall of the Dhaula Dh&aacute;r and separated from Kulu by
the mountains of Bara Bang&aacute;hal. It consists of the
five <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of K&aacute;ngra, Palampur, Nurpur, Dera, and
Ham&iacute;rpur. The first two occupy the rich and beautiful
K&aacute;ngra Valley. They are separated from the other three
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> by a medley of low hills with a general trend from
N.W. to S.E.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> They are drained by the Bi&aacute;s, and are
much more broken and poorer than the K&aacute;ngra Valley.
The tea industry, once important, is now dead so far
as carried on by English planters. The low hills have
extensive <i>ch&iacute;r</i> pine forests. They have to be managed
mainly in the interests of the local population, and are
so burdened with rights that conservation is a very
difficult problem. In 1911 the population of the five
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> amounted to 645,583. The most important tribes
are Brahmans, R&aacute;jputs, and hardworking G&iacute;rths. The
hill Brahman is usually a farmer pure and simple.</p>

<p><b>Hoshy&aacute;rpur</b> became a British possession in 1846 after
the first Sikh War. It is a typically submontane
district. A line of low bare hills
known as the Solasingh&iacute; Range divides it
from K&aacute;ngra. Further west the Kat&aacute;r dh&aacute;r,
a part of the Siw&aacute;liks, runs through the heart
of the district.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> Between these two ranges lies the fertile
Jaswan Dun corresponding to the Una <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. The other
three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Garhshankar, Hoshy&aacute;rpur, and Das&uacute;ya,
are to the west of the Kat&aacute;r dh&aacute;r. Una is drained
by the Soan, a tributary of the Sutlej. The western
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> have a light loam soil of great fertility, except
where it has been overlaid by sand from the numerous
<i>chos</i> or torrents which issue from the Siw&aacute;liks. The
denudation of that range was allowed to go on for an
inordinate time with disastrous results to the plains
below. At last the Panj&aacute;b Land Preservation (<i>Chos</i>)
Act II of 1890 gave the Government power to deal with
the evil, but it will take many years to remedy the
mischief wrought by past inaction. The rainfall averages
about 32 inches and the crops are secure. The population
has fallen off by 93,000 in 20 years, a striking instance of
the ravages of plague. The chief tribes are J&aacute;ts, R&aacute;jputs,
and G&uacute;jars.</p>

<p><b>Jalandhar District.</b>&mdash;Modern though the town of
Jalandhar looks it was the capital of a
large Hindu kingdom, which included also
Hoshy&aacute;rpur, Mand&iacute;, Suket, and Chamba, and
in the ninth century was a rival of Kashm&iacute;r
(page <a href='#Page_160'><b>160</b></a>). The present district is with the
exception of Simla the smallest, and for its
size the richest, in the province. It contains four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>,
Nawashahr, Phillaur, Jalandhar, and Nakodar. About
45 p.c. of the cultivation is protected by 28,000 wells.
Behind the long river frontage on the Sutlej is the Bet,
divided by a high bank from the more fertile uplands.
The soil of the latter is generally an excellent loam, but
there is a good deal of sand in the west of the district.
The rainfall averages about 26 inches and the climate is
healthy. The well cultivation is the best in the Panj&aacute;b.
Between 1901 and 1911 the population declined by 13 p.c.
J&aacute;ts and Arains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> both excellent cultivators, are the predominant

<p><b>Ludhi&aacute;na</b> on the opposite bank of the Sutlej is also a

Bet and Uplands with generally speaking a
good loam soil. But there are very sandy
outlying estates in the Jangal Des surrounded
by Pati&aacute;la and J&iacute;nd villages.  There are
three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Samr&aacute;la, Ludhi&aacute;na, and Jagr&aacute;on.
Of the cultivated area 26 p.c. is irrigated, from
wells (19) and from the Sirhind Canal (7). Wheat and
gram are the principal crops. Between 1901 and 1911
the population fell from 673,097 to 517,192, the chief
cause of decline being plague.</p>

<p>Sturdy hard-working J&aacute;ts are the backbone of the
peasantry. They furnish many recruits to the Army.
Ludhi&aacute;na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> is a thriving town and an important station

<p><b>Ferozepore</b> is a very large district. The Far&iacute;dkot
State nearly cuts it in two. The northern
division includes the <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Ferozepore,
Z&iacute;ra, and Moga, the last with an outlying
tract known as Mahr&aacute;j, which forms an
island surrounded by the territory of several
native states. The southern division contains
the <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Muktsar and F&aacute;zilka. Our connection with
Ferozepore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> began in 1809, and, when the widow of the
last Sikh chief of Ferozepore died in 1835, we assumed
direct responsibility for the administration of a considerable
part of the district. Two of the great battles of the
first Sikh War, Mudk&iacute; and Ferozesh&aacute;h or more properly
Pherushahr, were fought within its borders. Mamdot with
an area of about 400 square miles ceased to be independent
in 1855, but the descendant of the last ruler still holds
it in <i>jag&iacute;r</i>. F&aacute;zilka was added in 1864 when the Sirsa
district was broken up. Of the cultivated area 47&frac12; p.c.
is irrigated by the Sirhind Canal, the Grey Inundation
Canals, and wells. For the most part the district is
divided into three tracts, the riverain, Hith&aacute;r or Bet,
with a poor clay soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> and a weak population, the Ut&aacute;r,
representing river deposits of an older date when the
Sutlej ran far west of its present bed, and the Roh&iacute;, an
upland plain of good sandy loam, now largely irrigated
by the Sirhind Canal. The Grey Canals furnish a far
less satisfactory source of irrigation to villages in the
Bet and Ut&aacute;r. In different parts of this huge district the
rainfall varies from 10 to 22 inches. The chief crops
are gram and wheat. The J&aacute;ts are the chief tribe. In
the Uplands they are a fine sturdy race, but unfortunately
they are addicted to strong drink, and violent crime is
rife. Ferozepore has a large cantonment and arsenal
and a big trade in grain. It is an important railway
junction.</p>

<p><b>Gurd&aacute;spur</b> is a submontane district with a good
rainfall and a large amount of irrigation.
The crops are secure except in part of the
Shakargarh <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. 27 p.c. of the cultivated
area is irrigated, 16 by wells and 11 by the
Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal. Irrigation is only
allowed from the Canal for the Autumn
harvest. The chief crop is wheat and the area under
cane is unusually large. Of late years plague has been
very fatal and the population fell from 940,334 in 1901
to 836,771 in 1911. J&aacute;ts, R&aacute;jputs, Arains, G&uacute;jars, and
Brahmans, are the chief agricultural tribes, the first being
by far the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> important element. There are four
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Bat&aacute;la, Gurd&aacute;spur, and Path&aacute;nkot in the B&aacute;r&iacute;
Do&aacute;b, and Shakargarh to the west of the R&aacute;v&iacute;. Bat&aacute;la
is one of the most fertile and prosperous tracts in the
Panj&aacute;b and Gurd&aacute;spur is also thriving. Path&aacute;nkot is
damp, fever stricken, and unprosperous. It lies mostly
in the plains but contains a considerable area in the low
hills and higher up two enclaves, Bakloh and Dalhousie,
surrounded by Chamba villages. Shakargarh is much
more healthy, and is better off than Path&aacute;nkot. There is
good duck and snipe shooting to be got in some parts of
the district, as the drainage from the hills collects in
swamps and <i>jh&iacute;ls</i>.</p>

<p><b>Si&aacute;lkot</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> is another secure and fully cultivated submontane
district. It lies wholly in the Rechna
Do&aacute;b and includes a small well-watered hilly
tract, Bajw&aacute;t, on the borders of Jammu.
The R&aacute;v&iacute; divides Si&aacute;lkot from Amritsar
an the Chen&aacute;b separates it from Gujr&aacute;t.
The Degh and some smaller torrents run
through the district. In the south there is much hard
sour clay, part hitherto unculturable. But irrigation
from the Upper Chen&aacute;b Canal will give a new value to it.
There are five <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Zafarw&aacute;l, Si&aacute;lkot, Daska, Pasr&uacute;r,
and Raya.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> The chief crop is wheat which is largely
grown on the wells, numbering 22,000. The pressure of
the population on the soil was considerable, but since
1891 the total has fallen from 1,119,847 to 979,553 as the
result of plague and emigration to the new canal colonies.
Christianity has obtained a considerable number of converts
in Si&aacute;lkot. The J&aacute;ts form the backbone of the
peasantry. R&aacute;jputs and Arains are also important tribes,
but together they are not half as numerous as the J&aacute;ts.</p>

<p><b>Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> is a very large district in the Rechna
Do&aacute;b, with five <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Waz&iacute;r&aacute;b&aacute;d, Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la,
Sharakpur, H&aacute;fiz&aacute;b&aacute;d, and Kh&aacute;ng&aacute;h
Dogr&aacute;n. The rainfall varies from 20 inches
on the Si&aacute;lkot border to ten or eleven in the
extreme south-west corner of the district. Gujr&aacute;nw&aacute;la
is naturally divided into three tracts: the Riverain of the
R&aacute;v&iacute; and Chen&aacute;b, the B&aacute;ngar or well tract, and the B&aacute;r
once very partially cultivated, but now commanded by
the Lower and Upper Chen&aacute;b Canals. Enormous development
has taken place in the H&aacute;fiz&aacute;b&aacute;d and Kh&aacute;ng&aacute;h
Dogr&aacute;n <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> in the 20 years since the Lower Chen&aacute;b
Canal was opened. Of late years the rest of the district
has suffered from plague and emigration, and has not
prospered. But a great change will be effected by
irrigation from the Upper Chen&aacute;b Canal, which is just
beginning. In the east of the district much sour clay
will become culturable land, and the B&aacute;r will be transformed
as in the two <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> watered by the older canal.
Of the cultivated area 73&frac12; p.c. is irrigated, 36&frac12; from
wells and 37 from canals. The chief crops are wheat
and gram. There is, as is usual in the Western Panj&aacute;b,
a great preponderance of Spring crops. The J&aacute;ts are far
and away the strongest element in the population.</p>

<p><b>Amritsar</b> is a small district lying in the B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b
between Gurd&aacute;spur and Lahore. 62 p.c. of
the cultivated area is irrigated, half from
12,000 wells and half from the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute;
Do&aacute;b Canal.  Unfortunately much waterlogging
exists, due to excessive use of canal
water and defective drainage. Measures are
now being taken to deal with this great evil, which has
made the town of Amritsar and other parts of the district
liable to serious outbreaks of fever. There are two small
riverain tracts on the Bi&aacute;s and R&aacute;v&iacute; and a poor piece of
country in Ajn&aacute;la<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> flooded by the Sakk&iacute;. The main part of
the district is a monotonous plain of fertile loam. The two
western <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Amritsar and Tarn T&aacute;ran, are prosperous,
Ajn&aacute;la is depressed. The rainfall is moderate averaging
21 or 22 inches, and the large amount of irrigation makes
the harvests secure. The chief crops are wheat and gram.</p>

though, like Amritsar, it has only three
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Lahore, Kas&uacute;r, and Ch&uacute;nian. 76 p.c.
of the cultivated area is irrigated, 23 from
wells and 53 from canals. There has been an enormous
extension of irrigation from the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal
in the past 30 years. Accordingly, though the rainfall
is somewhat scanty, the crops are generally secure.
The principal are wheat and gram. The district consists
of the Riverain on the Bi&aacute;s and R&aacute;v&iacute;, the latter extending
to both sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> of the river, and the plain of the M&aacute;njha,
largely held by strong and energetic Sikh J&aacute;ts. In the

<p><b>Gujr&aacute;t</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> lies in the Jech Do&aacute;b. The two northern
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Gujr&aacute;t and Khari&aacute;n, have many of
the features of a submontane tract. In the
former the Pabb&iacute;, a small range of low bare
hills, runs parallel to the Jhelam, and the
outliers of the Him&aacute;laya in Kashm&iacute;r are not far from
the northern border of the district. The uplands of
these two <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> slope pretty rapidly from N.E. to S.W.,
and contain much light soil. They are traversed by sandy
torrents, dry in winter, but sometimes very destructive
in the rains. Ph&aacute;lia on the other hand is a typical plain's
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. It has on the Chen&aacute;b a wide riverain, which also
separates the uplands of the Gujr&aacute;t <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> from that river.
The Jhelam valley is much narrower. Above the present
Chen&aacute;b alluvial tract there is in Ph&aacute;lia a well tract known
as the Hith&aacute;r whose soil consists of older river deposits,
and at a higher level a B&aacute;r, which will now receive
irrigation from the Upper Jhelam Canal and become a
rich agricultural tract. 26 p.c. of the cultivated area is
irrigated from wells. J&aacute;ts and G&uacute;jars are the great agricultural
tribes, the former predominating. The climate
is mild and the rainfall sufficient. The chief crops are
wheat and <i>b&aacute;jra</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Jhelam district</b> lies to the north of the river of
the same name. The district is divided into
three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Jhelam, Chakw&aacute;l, Pind D&aacute;dan
Kh&aacute;n. The river frontage is long, extending
for about 80 miles, and the river valley
is about eight miles wide. The district
contains part of the Salt Range, from the eastern end of
which the N&iacute;l&iacute; and Tilla spurs strike northwards, enclosing
very broken ravine country called the Khuddar. The Pabb&iacute;
tract, embracing the Chakw&aacute;l <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> and the north of the
Jhelam <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>, is much less broken, though it too is scored
by deep ravines and traversed by torrents, mostly flowing
north-west into the Soh&aacute;n river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> Two large torrents, the
Kah&aacute; and the Bunh&aacute;r, drain into the Jhelam. There are
some fertile valleys enclosed in the bare hills of the Salt
Range. The average rainfall is about 20 inches and the
climate is good. It is hot in summer, but the cold weather
is long, and sometimes for short periods severe. There
is little irrigation and the harvests are by no means
secure. The chief crops are wheat and <i>b&aacute;jra</i>. The country
breeds fine horses, fine cattle, and fine men. Numerically
J&aacute;ts, R&aacute;jputs, and Aw&aacute;ns are the principal tribes, but
the Janjuas and Gakkhars, though fewer in number, are
an interesting element in the population, having great
traditions behind them. Aw&aacute;ns, Janjuas, and Gakkhars
supply valuable recruits to the army. Most of the villages
are far from any railway.</p>

<p><b>R&aacute;walpind&iacute;</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> is the smallest district in the division.
Along the whole eastern border the Jhelam,
which runs in a deep gorge, divides it from
Kashm&iacute;r. There are four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Murree,
Kah&uacute;ta, R&aacute;walpind&iacute;, and G&uacute;jar Kh&aacute;n. The
first is a small wedge of mountainous
country between Kashm&iacute;r and Haz&aacute;ra. The hills are
continued southwards at a lower level in the Kah&uacute;ta
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i> parallel with the Jhelam. The greater part of the
district consists of a high plateau of good light loam, in
parts much eaten into by ravines. Where, as often
happens, it is not flat the fields have to be carefully
banked up.  The plateau is drained by the Soh&aacute;n
and the K&aacute;nsh&iacute;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> The latter starting in the south
of Kah&uacute;ta runs through the south-east of the G&uacute;jar
Kh&aacute;n <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>, and for some miles forms the boundary of
the R&aacute;walpind&iacute; and Jhelam districts. The district is
very fully cultivated except in the hills. In the plains
the rainfall is sufficient and the soil very cool and clean,
except in the extreme west, where it is sometimes gritty,
and, while requiring more, gets less, rain. The chief
crops are wheat, the <i>Khar&iacute;f</i> pulses and <i>b&aacute;jra</i>.  The
climate is good. The cold weather is long, and, except
in January and February, when the winds from the
snows are very trying, it is pleasant. In the plains the
chief tribes are R&aacute;jputs and Aw&aacute;ns. Gakkhars are of
some importance in Kah&uacute;ta. In the Murree the leading
tribes are the Dh&uacute;nds and the Satt&iacute;s, the latter a fine
race, keen on military service.</p>

<p><b>Attock district.</b>&mdash;Though Attock is twice the size of
R&aacute;walpind&iacute; it has a smaller population.
Nature has decreed that it should be sparsely
peopled. The district stretches from the Salt
Range on the south to the Haz&aacute;ra border
on the north.  It contains itself the fine
K&aacute;lachitta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> range in the north, the small and barren Khair&iacute;
M&uacute;rat range in the centre, and a line of bare hills running
parallel with the Indus in the west. That river forms
the western boundary for 120 miles, dividing Attock
from Pesh&aacute;war and Koh&aacute;t. It receives in the Attock
district two tributaries, the Haro and the So&aacute;n. There
are four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Attock, Fatehjang, Pindigheb, and
Talagang. The northern <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> of Attock is most favoured
by nature. It contains the Chach plain, part of which
has a rich soil and valuable well irrigation, also on the
Haz&aacute;ra border a small group of estates watered by cuts
from the Haro. The south of the <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> is partly sandy
and partly has a dry gritty or stony soil. Here the
crops are very insecure. The rest of the district is a
plateau. The northern part consists of the <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of
Fatehjang and Pindigheb drained by the So&aacute;n and its
tributary the Sil. The southern is occupied by <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>
Talagang, a rough plateau with deep ravines and torrents
draining northwards into the So&aacute;n. In the valleys of
the Sil and So&aacute;n some good crops are raised. The soil
of the plateau is very shallow, and the rainfall being
scanty the harvest is often dried up. The chief crops
are wheat and <i>b&aacute;jra</i>. Aw&aacute;ns form the bulk of the
agricultural population.</p>

<p><b>Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;</b> is one of the largest districts, but has the
smallest population of any except Simla.
The Indus has a course of about 180 miles
in Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;. In the north it forms the
boundary between the Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> and
the small Isakhel <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> on the right bank. In
the south it divides the huge Bhakkar <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>, which is bigger
than an average district, from the Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n
district of the N.W.F. Province. It is joined from the
west by the Kurram, which has a short course in the south
of the Isakhel <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. The Salt Range extends into the
district, throwing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> off from its western extremity a spur
which runs north to the Indus opposite K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh. Four
tracts may be distinguished, two large and two small.
North and east of the Salt Range is the Khuddar or
ravine country, a little bit of the Aw&aacute;nk&aacute;r&iacute; or Aw&aacute;n's
land, which occupies a large space in Attock. West of
the Indus in the north the wild and desolate Bhang&iacute;-Khel
glen with its very scanty and scattered cultivation runs
north to the Koh&aacute;t Hills. The rest of the district consists
of the wide and flat valley of the Indus and the Thal or
Uplands. In the north the latter includes an area of
strong thirsty loam, but south of the railway it is a huge
expanse of sand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> rising frequently into hillocks and ridges
with some fertile bottoms of better soil. Except in the
north the Thal people used to make their living almost
entirely as shepherds and camel owners. There were
scattered little plots of better soil where wells were sunk,
and the laborious and careful cultivation was and is
Dutch in its neatness. Some millets were grown in the
autumn and the sandhills yielded melons. The people
have now learned that it is worth while to gamble with
a spring crop of gram, and this has led to an enormous
extension of the cultivated area. But even now in Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;
this is a comparatively small fraction of the total
area. There is a small amount of irrigation from wells
and in the neighbourhood of Isakhel from canal cuts
from the Kurram. Owing to the extreme scantiness of
the rainfall the riverain depends almost entirely on
the Indus floods, to assist the spread of which a number
of embankments are maintained. Everywhere in Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;
the areas both of crops sown and of crops that ripen
fluctuate enormously, and much of the revenue has
accordingly been put on a fluctuating basis. The chief
crops are wheat, <i>b&aacute;jra</i>, and gram. Jats<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> are in a great
majority Cis-Indus, but Path&aacute;ns are important in Isakhel.</p>

<p><b>Sh&aacute;hpur</b> is also a very large district with the three
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Bhera, Sh&aacute;hpur, and Sargodha in
the Jech Do&aacute;b, and on the west of the
Jhelam the huge Khush&aacute;b <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>, which in
size exceeds the other three put together.
The principal tribes are Jats Cis-Jhelam, Aw&aacute;ns in
the Salt Range, and Jats and Tiw&aacute;nas in Khush&aacute;b. The
Tiw&aacute;na Maliks have large estates on both sides of the
river and much local influence. East of the Jhelam the
colonization of the B&aacute;r after the opening of the Lower
Jhelam Canal has led to a great increase of population
and a vast extension<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> of the cultivated area, 71 p.c.
of which is irrigated. The part of the district in the
Jech Do&aacute;b consists of the river valleys of the Chen&aacute;b
and Jhelam, the Ut&aacute;r, and the B&aacute;r. The Chen&aacute;b
riverain is poor, the Jhelam very fertile with good well
irrigation. In the north of the district the Ut&aacute;r, a tract
of older alluvium, lies between the present valley of the
Jhelam and the B&aacute;r. It has hitherto been largely
irrigated by public and private inundation canals, but
this form of irrigation may be superseded by the excavation
of a new distributary from the Lower Jhelam Canal.
Till the opening of that canal the B&aacute;r was a vast
grazing area with a little cultivation on scattered wells
and in natural hollows. North of the Kir&aacute;na Hill
the soil is excellent and the country is now a sheet of
cultivation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> In the south of the B&aacute;r much of the land
is too poor to be worth tillage. The Khush&aacute;b <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>
consists of the Jhelam riverain, the Salt Range with
some fertile valleys hidden amid barren hills, the Moh&aacute;r
below the hills with a thirsty soil dependent on extremely
precarious torrent floods, and the Thal, similar to that
described on page <a href='#Page_260'><b>260</b></a>. The rainfall of the district is
scanty averaging eleven or twelve inches. The chief
crops are wheat, <i>b&aacute;jra</i> and <i>jow&aacute;r</i>, <i>char&iacute;</i> and cotton.</p>

<p>The <b>Montgomery</b> district takes its name from Sir Robert
Montgomery (page <a href='#Page_192'><b>192</b></a>). It lies in the B&aacute;r&iacute;
Do&aacute;b between the Sutlej and the R&aacute;v&iacute;. It
consists of the two R&aacute;v&iacute; <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Gugera
and Montgomery, and the two Sutlej <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>
of Dip&aacute;lpur and P&aacute;kpattan. The trans-R&aacute;v&iacute;
area of the Montgomery district was transferred to
Lyallpur in April, 1913. It is included in the figures for
area and population given in the margin.</p>

<p>The backbone of the district is a high and dry tract
known as the Ganj&iacute; or Bald B&aacute;r. The advent of the
Lower B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal will entirely change the character
of this desert. Its south-eastern boundary is a high
bank marking the course of the old bed of the Bi&aacute;s.
Below this is the wide Sutlej valley. The part beyond
the influence of river floods depends largely on
the Kh&aacute;nw&aacute;h and Soh&aacute;g P&aacute;ra inundation Canals. The
R&aacute;v&iacute; valley to the north-west of the B&aacute;r is naturally
fertile and has good well irrigation. But it has suffered
much by the failure of the R&aacute;v&iacute; floods.</p>

<p>The peasantry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> belongs largely to various tribes described
vaguely as J&aacute;ts. The most important are K&aacute;thias,
Watt&uacute;s, and Kharrals. The last gave trouble in 1857
and were severely punished. The Dip&aacute;lpur Kambohs are
much more hard-working than these semi-pastoral J&aacute;ts.
There is already a small canal colony on the Soh&aacute;g P&aacute;ra
Canals and arrangements for the colonization of the
Ganj&iacute; B&aacute;r are now in progress.</p>

<p>The <b>Lyallpur district</b> occupies most of the S&aacute;ndal B&aacute;r,
which a quarter of a century ago was a
desert producing scrub jungle and, if rains
were favourable, excellent grass. It was the
home of a few nomad graziers. The area of
the district, which was formed in 1904 and
added to from time to time, has been taken
out of the Crown Waste of the Jhang and Montgomery
districts on its colonization after the opening of the Lower
Chen&aacute;b Canal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> Some old villages near the present borders
of these two districts have been included. The colonization
of the S&aacute;ndal B&aacute;r has been noticed on pages 139-140.
The figures for area and population given in the margin
are for the district as it was before the addition of the

<p>Lyallpur is divided into the four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Lyallpur,
J&aacute;ranwala, Samundr&iacute;, and Toba Tek Singh. It consists
almost entirely of a flat plain of fertile loam with fringes
of poor land on the eastern, western, and southern edges.
The cultivated area is practically all canal irrigated. The
rainfall of 10 inches does not encourage dry cultivation.
The chief crops are wheat, the oil seed called <i>toria</i>,
cotton, and gram. The area of the first much exceeds
that of the other three put together. There is an
enormous export of wheat and oil seeds to Kar&aacute;ch&iacute;.</p>

<p><b>Jhang</b><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> now consists of a wedge of country lying between
Lyallpur on the east and Sh&aacute;hpur, Mianw&aacute;l&iacute;,
and Muzaffargarh on the west. It contains
the valleys of the Chen&aacute;b and Jhelam rivers,
which unite to the south-west of the district
headquarters and flow as a single stream
to the southern boundary. The valley of the Jhelam
is pretty and fertile, that of the Chen&aacute;b exactly the
reverse. In the west of the district part of the Thal is
included in the boundary. The high land between the
river valleys is much of it poor. Irrigation from the
Lower Jhelam Canal is now available. There is a fringe
of high land on the east of the Chen&aacute;b valley, partly
commanded by the Lower Chen&aacute;b Canal. Jhang is divided
into the three large <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Jhang, Chiniot, and Shorkot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
The rainfall is about ten inches and the summer long and
very hot. The chief crops are wheat, <i>jow&aacute;r</i>, and <i>char&iacute;</i>.
The Si&aacute;ls are few in number, but are the tribe that stands
highest in rank as representing the former rulers.</p>

<p><b>Mult&aacute;n</b> occupies the south of the B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b. The
R&aacute;v&iacute; flows from east to west across the north
of the district and falls into the Chen&aacute;b
within its boundary. The Sutlej meets the

<p>A part of the Kab&iacute;rw&aacute;la <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> lies beyond the R&aacute;v&iacute;.
The other four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> are Mult&aacute;n, Shuj&aacute;b&aacute;d, Lodhran,
and Mails&iacute;. In a very hot district with an average rainfall
of six inches cultivation must depend on irrigation
or river floods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> The present sources of irrigation are
inundation canals from the Chen&aacute;b and Sutlej supplemented
by well irrigation, and the Sidhnai Canal from
the R&aacute;v&iacute;. The district consists of the river valleys,
older alluvial tracts slightly higher than these valleys,
but which can be reached by inundation canals<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, and the
high central B&aacute;r, which is a continuation of the Ganj&iacute;
B&aacute;r in Montgomery. Part of this will be served by the
new Lower B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal. The population consists
mainly of miscellaneous tribes grouped together under
the name of Jats, the ethnological significance of which
in the Western Panj&aacute;b is very slight. They are Muhammadans.
The district is well served by railways.</p>

<p><b>Muzaffargarh</b> is with the exception of K&aacute;ngra the
biggest Panj&aacute;b district. It forms a large
triangle with its apex in the south at the
junction of the Indus and Panjnad. On
the west the Indus forms the boundary
for 180 miles. On the east Muzaffargarh has
a river boundary with Bah&aacute;walpur and Mult&aacute;n, but,
where it marches with Jhang, is separated from it by the
area which that district possesses in the Sind S&aacute;gar Do&aacute;b.
There are four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Leia, Sin&aacute;nwan, Muzaffargarh, and
Alipur, the first being equal in area to a moderately sized
district. The greater part of Leia and Sin&aacute;nwan is
occupied by the Thal. The southern tongue of the
Thal extends into the Muzaffargarh <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. The rest
of that district is a heavily inundated or irrigated tract,
the part above flood level being easily reached by inundation
canals. Dry cultivation is impossible with a yearly
rainfall of about six inches. The chief crop is wheat. In
the south of the district the people live in frail grass huts,
and when the floods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> are out transfer themselves and

<p><b>Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n district.</b>&mdash;When the N. W. Frontier
Province was separated from the Panj&aacute;b, the
older province retained all the trans-Indus
country in which Biluches were the predominant
tribe. The Panj&aacute;b therefore kept
Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n. It has a river frontage
on the Indus about 230 miles in length and on the
west is bounded by the Sulim&aacute;n Range, part of which
is included within the district. The Deputy Commissioner
of Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n and the Commissioner of
Mult&aacute;n spend part of the hot weather at Fort Munro.
The wide Indus valley is known as the Sindh. The
tract between it and the Hills is the Pach&aacute;dh. It is
seamed by hill torrents, three of which, the Vehoa, the
Sangarh, and the Kah&aacute;, have a thread of water even in
the cold season. The heat in summer is extreme, and
the <i>luh</i>, a moving current of hot air, claims its human
victims from time to time. The cultivation in the Sindh
depends on the river floods and inundation canals, helped
by wells. In the Pach&aacute;dh dams are built to divert the
water of the torrents into embanked fields. The cultivated
area is recorded as 1723 square miles, but this is enormously
in excess of the cropped areas, for a very large part of
the embanked area is often unsown. The encroachments
of the Indus have enforced the transfer of the district
headquarters from Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n to a new town at
Choratta. Biluches are the dominant tribe both in
numbers and political importance. They with few exceptions
belong to one or other of the eight organized clans
or tumans, Kasr&aacute;nis, Sor&iacute; Lunds, Khosas, Lagh&aacute;r&iacute;s, Tibb&iacute;
Lunds, Gurch&aacute;n&iacute;s, Drishaks, and Maz&aacute;r&iacute;s. The most
important clans are Maz&aacute;r&iacute;s, Lagh&aacute;r&iacute;s, and Gurch&aacute;n&iacute;s.
Care has been taken to uphold the authority of the
chiefs. The Deputy Commissioner is political officer for
such of the independent Biluch tribes across the administrative
frontier as are not included in the Biluchist&aacute;n
Agency. Regular troops have all been removed from the
district. The peace of the borderland is maintained by
a tribal militia under the command of a British officer.</p>

<p><b>Phulkian States.</b>&mdash;The three Phulkian States of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Pati&aacute;la, J&iacute;nd, and N&aacute;bha form a political
agency under the Panj&aacute;b Government. They
occupy, with Bah&aacute;walpur and Hiss&aacute;r, the
bulk of that great wedge of light loam and
sand which R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, physically considered, pushes
northwards almost to the Sutlej. In the Phulkian States
this consists of two tracts, the Pow&aacute;dh and the Jangal
Des. The former, which occupies the north and north-east
of their territory, possesses a light fertile loam soil
and a very moderate natural water level, so that well
irrigation is easy. The Jangal Des is a great tract of
sandy loam and sand in the south-west. Water lies too
deep for the profitable working of wells, but the harvests
are far less insecure than one would suppose looking to
the scantiness of the rainfall. The soil is wonderfully cool
and drought-resisting. The dry cultivation consists of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
millets in the Autumn, and of gram and mixed crops
of wheat or barley and gram in the Spring, harvest.
The three states have rather more than a one-third
share in the Sirhind Canal, their shares <i>inter se</i> being
Pati&aacute;la 83&middot;6, N&aacute;bha 8&middot;8, and J&iacute;nd 7&middot;6. Portions of the
Pow&aacute;dh and Jangal Des are irrigated. In the case of
the Pow&aacute;dh there has been in some places over irrigation
considering how near the surface the water table is.
The Nirw&aacute;na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> in Pati&aacute;la and the part of J&iacute;nd
which lies between Karn&aacute;l and Rohtak is a bit of the
B&aacute;ngar tract of the south-eastern Panj&aacute;b, with a strong
loam soil and a naturally deep water level. The former
receives irrigation from the Sirsa, and the latter from the
H&aacute;nsi, branch of the Western Jamna Canal. The outlying
tracts to the south of Rohtak and Gurg&aacute;on, acquired
after the Mutiny, are part of the dry sandy R&aacute;jput&aacute;na
desert, in which the <i>Khar&iacute;f</i> is the chief harvest, and the
millets and gram the principal crops. In addition
Pati&aacute;la has an area of 294 square miles of territory
immediately below and in the Simla Hills. The territory
of the Phulkian States is scattered and intermixed, and
they have islands in British districts and <i>vice versa</i>, a
natural result of their historic origin and development.</p>

<p>Phul was the sixth in descent from Bary&aacute;m, a Sidhu

<p>The century and more which elapsed between the
grant and Phul's death in 1652 were filled with continual
fighting with the Bhatt&iacute;s. Phul's second son R&aacute;ma
obtained from the Governor of S&iacute;rhind the <i>Chaudhr&aacute;yat</i>
of the Jangal Des. When Ahmad Sh&aacute;h defeated the
Sikhs near Barn&aacute;la in 1762, R&aacute;ma's son, &Aacute;la Singh, was
one of his prisoners.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> He was a chief of such importance
that his conqueror gave him the title of R&aacute;ja and the
right to coin money. But &Aacute;la Singh found it prudent
to join next year in the capture of Sirhind. From
the division of territory which followed the separate
existence of the Phulkian States begins. The manner in
which they came in 1809 under British protection has
already been related. The R&aacute;ja of Pati&aacute;la was our
ally in the Gurkha War in 1814, and received the
Pinjaur <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. The active loyalty displayed in 1857 was
suitably rewarded by accessions of territory. The right
of adoption was conferred, and special arrangements
made to prevent lapse, if nevertheless the line in any
state failed.</p>

The other three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> R&aacute;jpura, Bannur, and Ghanaur
are in the Pow&aacute;dh. The Amargarh <i>niz&aacute;mat</i> with an

are rich and fertile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> well tracts. Amargarh is in the Jangal
Des to the south-west of S&aacute;hibgarh. It receives irrigation
from the Kotla branch of the Sirhind Canal. The Karmgarh
<i>niz&aacute;mat</i> with an area of 1835 square miles contains
the four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Pati&aacute;la, Bhaw&aacute;nigarh, Sun&aacute;m, and
Nirw&aacute;na. The headquarters are at Bhaw&aacute;nigarh. The
first three are partly in the Pow&aacute;dh, and partly in the
Jangal Des. Nirw&aacute;na is in the B&aacute;ngar. There is much
irrigation from the Sirhind and Western Jamna Canals.
The An&aacute;hadgarh <i>niz&aacute;mat</i> lies wholly in the Jangal Des.
It has an area of 1836 square miles, and is divided into
three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, An&aacute;hadgarh, Bhikhi, and Govindgarh. The
headquarters are at Barn&aacute;la or An&aacute;hadgarh. The Mohindarpur
<i>niz&aacute;mat</i> lies far away to the south on the borders
of Jaipur and Alwar (see map on page <a href='#Page_226'><b>226</b></a>). Its area is
only 576 miles and it has two <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Mohindargarh or
K&aacute;naud and Narnaul. K&aacute;naud is the headquarters.</p>

<p>The history down to 1763 has already been related.
R&aacute;ja &Aacute;la Singh died in 1765 and was succeeded by his
grandson Amar Singh (1765-1781), who was occupied in
continual warfare with his brother and his neighbours, as
became a Sikh chieftain of those days. His son, S&aacute;hib
Singh (1781-1813), came under British protection in
1809. Karm Singh (1813-1845), his successor, was our
ally in the Gurkha War. Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Narindar Singh,
K.C.S.I. (1845-1862), was a wise and brave man, who
gave manful and most important help in 1857. His
son, Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Mohindar Singh (1862-1876), succeeded at
the age of ten and died 14 years later. His eldest son,
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Rajindar Singh (1876-1900), was only four
when he succeeded and died at the age of 28. Another
long minority, that of the present Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Bhupindar
Singh, only came to an end a few years ago. In the last
fifty years Pati&aacute;la has in consequence of three minorities
been governed, and as a rule successfully governed, for
long periods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> by Councils of Regency. The State in 1879
sent a contingent of 1100 men to the Afgh&aacute;n War. It
maintains an Imperial Service Force consisting of two
fine regiments of infantry and one of cavalry. Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja
Rajindar Singh went with one of these regiments to the
Tirah Expedition.</p>

<p><b>J&iacute;nd.</b>&mdash;A third of the population of J&iacute;nd consists
of Hindu and Sikh J&aacute;ts. There are two
<i>niz&aacute;mats</i>, Sangr&uacute;r and J&iacute;nd, the latter divided
into the <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of J&iacute;nd and D&aacute;dr&iacute; (map on
page <a href='#Page_226'><b>226</b></a>). The Sangr&uacute;r villages are interspersed
among those of the other Phulkian
States, and form a part of the Jangal Des.
J&iacute;nd is in the B&aacute;ngar, and D&aacute;dr&iacute;, separated from
J&iacute;nd by the Rohtak district, is partly in Hari&aacute;na and
partly in the sandy R&aacute;jput&aacute;na desert. The rainfall
varies from 17 inches at Sangr&uacute;r to ten inches at D&aacute;dr&iacute;.
Sangr&uacute;r is irrigated by the Sirhind, and J&iacute;nd by the
Western Jamna, Canal. D&aacute;dr&iacute; is a dry sandy tract,
in which the Autumn millets are the chief crop. The
revenue in 1911-12 was 19 <i>l&aacute;khs</i> (&pound;126,700). For
imperial service J&iacute;nd keeps up a fine battalion of
infantry 600 strong. The real founder of the state was
Gajpat Singh, who was a chief of great vigour. He
conquered J&iacute;nd and in 1774 deprived his relative, the chief
of N&aacute;bha, of Sangr&uacute;r. He died in 1789. His successor,
R&aacute;ja Bh&aacute;g Singh, was a good ally of the British Government.
He died after a long and successful career in
1819. His son, Fateh Singh, only survived him by three
years. Sangat Singh succeeded to troublous times and
died childless in 1834. His second cousin, R&aacute;ja Sar&uacute;p
Singh, was only allowed to inherit the territory acquired
by Gajpat Singh, from whom he derived his claim. But
the gallant and valuable services rendered by R&aacute;ja Sar&uacute;p
Singh in 1857<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> enabled him to enlarge his State by the grant
of the D&aacute;dr&iacute; territory and of
thirteen villages near Sangr&uacute;r.
He died in 1864. His son
Raghub&iacute;r Singh (1864-1887)
was a vigorous and successful
ruler. He gave loyal help in
the K&uacute;ka outbreak and in the
Second Afgh&aacute;n War. His grandson,
the present Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Ranbir
Singh, K.C.S.I., was only eight
when he succeeded, and J&iacute;nd
was managed by a Council of
Regency for a number of years. Full powers were given
to the chief in 1899.</p>

<p><b>N&aacute;bha</b> consists of twelve patches of territory in the
north scattered among the possessions of
Pati&aacute;la, J&iacute;nd, and Far&iacute;dkot, and two other
patches in the extreme south on the border
of Gurg&aacute;on. The northern section of the
state is divided into the eastern <i>niz&aacute;mat</i> of
Amloh in the Pow&aacute;dh and the western
<i>niz&aacute;mat</i> of Phul in the Jangal Des. Both now receive
irrigation from the Sirhind Canal. The B&aacute;wal <i>niz&aacute;mat</i> is
part of the arid R&aacute;jput&aacute;na desert. J&aacute;ts, who are mostly
Sikhs, constitute 30 p.c. of the population.</p>

<p>The State is well served by railways, N&aacute;bha itself
being on the R&aacute;jpura-Bhatinda line. The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja
maintains a battalion of infantry for imperial service.
Ham&iacute;r Singh, one of the chiefs who joined in the capture
of Sirhind, may be considered the first R&aacute;ja. He died in
1783 and was succeeded by his young son, Jaswant
Singh. When he grew to manhood Jaswant Singh
proved a very capable chief and succeeded in aggrandising
his State, which he ruled for 57 years. His son, Deoindar
Singh (1840&mdash;47),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> was deposed, as he was considered to have
failed to support the British Government when the Khalsa
army crossed the Sutlej in 1845. A fourth of the N&aacute;bha
territory was confiscated. Bharpur Singh, who became
chief in 1857, did excellent service at that critical time, and
the B&aacute;wal <i>niz&aacute;mat</i> was his reward. He was succeeded by
his brother, Bhagw&aacute;n Singh, in 1863. With Bhagw&aacute;n
Singh the line died out in 1871,
but under the provisions of the
<i>sanad</i> granted after the Mutiny
a successor was selected from
among the Badr&uacute;khan chiefs in
the person of the late Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja
Sir Hira Singh. No choice could
have been more happy. Hira
Singh for 40 years ruled his
State on old fashioned lines
with much success. Those who
had the privilege of his friendship
will not soon forget the
alert figure wasted latterly by disease, the gallant bearing,
or the obstinate will of a Sikh chieftain of a type now
departed. His son, Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Ripudaman Singh, succeeded
in 1911.</p>

<p><b>Kap&uacute;rthala.</b>&mdash;The main part consists of a strip of
territory mostly in the valley of the Bi&aacute;s,
and interposed between that river and Jalandhar.
This is divided into the four <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>
of Bholath, Dhilwan, Kap&uacute;rthala, and Sult&aacute;npur.
There is a small island of territory
in Hoshy&aacute;rpur, and a much larger one, the
Phagw&aacute;ra <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>, projecting southwards from
the border<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> of that district into Jalandhar. Two-thirds of
the area is cultivated and the proportion of high-class
crops is large. The chief agricultural tribes are the
Muhammadan Arains and the J&aacute;ts, most of whom are
Sikhs.</p>

<p>The real founder of the Kap&uacute;rthala house was Sard&aacute;r
Jassa Singh Ahluw&aacute;lia, who in 1763, when Sirhind fell,
was the leading Sikh chief in the Panj&aacute;b. He captured
Kap&uacute;rthala in 1771 and made it his headquarters, and
died in 1783. A distant relative, B&aacute;gh Singh, succeeded.
His successor, Fateh Singh, was a sworn brother of Ranj&iacute;t
Singh, with whom he exchanged turbans. But an alliance
between the weak and the strong is not free from fears,
and in 1826 Fateh Singh, who had large possessions south
of the Sutlej, fled thither and asked the protection of the
British Government. He returned however to Kap&uacute;rthala
in 1827, and the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja never pushed matters
with Fateh Singh to extremities. The latter died in
1836. His successor, Nih&aacute;l Singh, was a timid man,
and his failure to support the British in 1845 led to the
loss of his Cis-Sutlej estates.
In 1849 he took the English
side and was given the title
of R&aacute;ja. Randh&iacute;r Singh
succeeded in 1852. His
conspicuous services in the
Mutiny were rewarded with
the grant of estates in Oudh.
The present Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja, Sir
Jagatj&iacute;t Singh Bah&aacute;dur,
G.C.S.I., is a grandson of
Randh&iacute;r Singh. He was a
young child when he succeeded
in 1877. The State maintains a battalion of
infantry for imperial service.</p>

<p><b>Bah&aacute;walpur</b> is by far the largest of the Panj&aacute;b States.
But the greater part of it is at present
desert, and the population, except in the
river tract, is very sparse. Bah&aacute;walpur
stretches from Ferozepore on the north to
the Sindh border. It has a river frontage
exceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> 300 miles on the Sutlej, Panjnad, and
Indus. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 1451
square miles, and of this 83 p.c. was irrigated and
10 p.c. flooded. The rainfall is only five inches and
the climate is very hot. South and east of the rivers
is a tract of low land known as the "Sindh," which
widens out to the south. It is partly flooded and
partly irrigated by inundation canals with the help of
wells. Palm groves are a conspicuous feature in the
Sindh. Behind it is a great stretch of strong loam or
"<i>pat</i>," narrow in the south, but widening out in the north.
It is bounded on the south-east by a wide depression
known as the Hakra,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> probably at one time the bed
of the Sutlej. At present little cultivation is possible
in the <i>pat</i>, but there is some hope that a canal taking out
on the right bank of the Sutlej in Ferozepore may bring
the water of that river back to it. South of the Hakra
is a huge tract of sand and sand dunes, known as the
Roh&iacute; or Cholist&aacute;n, which is part of the R&aacute;jput&aacute;na desert.
There are three <i>niz&aacute;mats</i>, Minchin&aacute;b&aacute;d in the north,
Bah&aacute;walpur in the middle, and Kh&aacute;npur in the south.
The capital, Bah&aacute;walpur, is close to the bridge at Adamw&aacute;han
by which the N.W. Railway crosses the Sutlej.
The ruling family belongs to the Abb&aacute;s&iacute; D&aacute;udpotra clan,
and came originally from Sindh. Sadik Muhammad
Kh&aacute;n, who received the title of Naw&aacute;b from N&aacute;dir
Sh&aacute;h, when he invaded the Deraj&aacute;t in 1739, may be
considered the real founder of the State. The Naw&aacute;b
Muhummad Bah&aacute;wal Khan III, threatened with invasion
by Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Ranj&iacute;t Singh, made a treaty with the
British Government in 1833. He was our faithful ally
in the first Afgh&aacute;n War, and gave valuable help against
Diw&aacute;n Mulr&aacute;j in 1848. The next three reigns extending
from 1852 to 1866 were brief and troubled. Naw&aacute;b
Sadik Muhummad Kh&aacute;n IV, who succeeded in 1866,
was a young child, and for the next thirteen years the
State was managed by Captain Minchin and Captain
L. H. Grey as Superintendents. The young Naw&aacute;b was
installed in 1879, and henceforth ruled with the help
of a Council. In the Afgh&aacute;n War of 1879-1880 Bah&aacute;walpur
did very useful service. The Naw&aacute;b died in 1899.
A short minority followed during which Colonel L. H. Grey
again became Superintendent. The young Naw&aacute;b, Muhammad
Bah&aacute;wal Kh&aacute;n V, had but a brief reign. He
was succeeded by the present Chief, Naw&aacute;b Sadik
Muhummad Kh&aacute;n V, a child of eight or nine years. The
State is managed by a Council aided by the advice of the
political Agent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> From 1903 to 1913, the Agent for the
Phulkian States was in charge, but a separate Agent has
recently been appointed for Bah&aacute;walpur and Far&iacute;dkot.

<p><b>Sirm&uacute;r</b> (<b>N&aacute;han</b>) lies to the north of the Amb&aacute;la

catchment area of the Gir&iacute;, a tributary of
the Jamna. It is for the most part a

Gir&iacute; rising to a height of 11,982 feet. The capital, N&aacute;han
(3207 feet), near the southern border is in the Siw&aacute;lik
range. In the south-east of the State is the rich valley
known as the Ki&aacute;rda D&uacute;n, reclaimed and colonized by
R&aacute;ja Shamsh&eacute;r Park&aacute;sh. There are valuable <i>deod&aacute;r</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> and
<i>s&aacute;l</i> forests. A good road connects N&aacute;han with Bar&aacute;ra
on the N.W. Railway. In 1815 the British Government
having driven out the Gurkhas put Fateh Park&aacute;sh on
the throne of his ancestors. His troops fought on the
English side in the first Sikh War. His successors, R&aacute;ja
Sir Shamsher Park&aacute;sh, G.C.S.I. (1856-98), and R&aacute;ja
Sir Surindar Bikram Park&aacute;sh, K.C.S.I. (1898-1911),

<p><b>Chamba</b> lies to the N. of K&aacute;ngra from which it is
divided by the Dhauladh&aacute;r (map, p. 284).
The southern and northern parts of the State
are occupied respectively by the basins of
the R&aacute;v&iacute; and the Chandrabh&aacute;g&aacute; or Chen&aacute;b. Chamba is
a region of lofty mountains with some fertile valleys
in the south and west. Only about one-nineteenth
of the area is cultivated. The snowy range of the Mid-Him&aacute;laya
separates the R&aacute;v&iacute; valley from that of the
Chandrabh&aacute;g&aacute;, and the great Z&aacute;nsk&aacute;r chain with its
outliers occupies the territory beyond the Chen&aacute;b, where
the rainfall is extremely small and Tibetan conditions
prevail. The State contains fine forests and excellent
sport is to be got in its mountains. There are five
<i>waz&aacute;rats</i> or districts, Brahmaur or Barmaur, Chamba,
Bhattoyat, Chaura, and P&aacute;ng&iacute;.</p>

<p>The authentic history of this S&uacute;rajbans&iacute; Rajput
principality goes back to the seventh century. It came
into the British sphere in 1846. During part of the reign
of R&aacute;ja Sh&aacute;m Singh (1873-1904), the present R&aacute;ja, Sir
Bhure Singh, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., administered the State as
Waz&iacute;r,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> filling a difficult position with loyalty and honour.
He is a R&aacute;jput gentleman of the best type. The R&aacute;ja
owns the land of the State, but the people have a permanent
tenant right in cultivated land.</p>

<p><b>Simla Hill States.</b>&mdash;The Deputy Commissioner of
Simla is political officer with the title of Superintendent
of nineteen, or, including the tributaries of Bashahr,
Keonthal, and Jubbal, of 28 states with a total area of
6355 square miles, a population of 410,453, and revenues
amounting to a little over ten <i>l&aacute;khs</i> (&pound;66,000). The
States vary in size from the patch of four square miles
ruled by the Th&aacute;kur of Bija to the 388r square miles
included in Bashahr. Only four other States have areas
exceeding 125 square miles, namely, Bil&aacute;spur (448),
Keonthal (359), Jubbal (320), and Hind&uacute;r or Nalagarh
(256). Excluding feudatories the revenues vary from
Rs. 900 (or a little over &pound;1 a week) in Mangal to Rs. 190,000
(&pound;12,666)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> in Bil&aacute;spur. The chiefs are all R&aacute;jputs, who
came under our protection at the close of the Gurkha
War.</p>

<p>The watershed of the Sutlej and Jamna runs through
the tract. The range which forms the watershed of the
Sutlej and the Jamna starts from the Shinka Pass on the
south border of Bashahr and passes over Hattu and
Simla. In Bashahr it divides the catchment areas of
the Rup&iacute;n and P&aacute;bar rivers, tributaries of the Tons and
therefore of the Jamna, from those of the B&aacute;spa and the
Nogl&iacute;, which are affluents of the Sutlej. West of Bashahr
the chief tributary of the Jamna is the Gir&iacute; and of the
Sutlej the G&aacute;mbhar, which rises near Kasaul&iacute;. In the
east Bashahr has a large area north of the Sutlej drained
by its tributary the Spit&iacute; and smaller streams. In the
centre the Sutlej is the northern boundary of the Simla
Hill States. In the west Bil&aacute;spur extends across that
river. The east of Bashahr is entirely in the Sutlej
basin.</p>

<p><b>Bashahr.</b>&mdash;The chain which forms the watershed of
the Sutlej and Jamna rises from about
12,000 feet at Hattu in the west to nearly
20,000 feet on the Tibet border.  Two
peaks in the chain exceed 20,000 feet. Further north
Raldang to the east of Ch&iacute;n&iacute; is 21,250 feet high, and
in the north-east on the Tibet border there are two
giants about 1000 feet higher. Generally speaking the
Sutlej runs in a deep gorge but at Ch&iacute;n&iacute; and Sar&aacute;han
the valley widens out. The main valley of the P&aacute;bar is
not so narrow as that of the Sutlej, while the side valleys
descend in easy slopes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> to the river beds. The B&aacute;spa has
a course of 35 miles. In the last ten miles it falls 2000
feet and is hemmed in by steep mountains. Above this
gorge the B&aacute;spa valley is four or five miles wide and
consists of a succession of plateaux rising one above the
other from the river's banks. Bashahr is divided into
two parts, Bashahr proper and Kun&aacute;war. The latter
occupies the Sutlej valley in the north-east of the State.
It covers an area of about 1730 square miles and is very
sparsely peopled. In the north of Kun&aacute;war the predominant
racial type is Mongoloid and the religion is
Buddhism. The capital of Bashahr, R&aacute;mpur, on the
left bank of the Sutlej is at an elevation of 3300 feet.
The Gurkhas never succeeded in conquering Kun&aacute;war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
They occupied Bashahr, but in 1815 the British Government
restored the authority of the R&aacute;ja. The present
chief, Shamsher Singh, is an old man, who succeeded as
long ago as 1850. He is incapable of managing the State
and an English officer is at present in charge.</p>

<p><b>Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n</b> lies to the north of Dera Gh&aacute;zi

physical features. It is divided into the
three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of T&aacute;nk, Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n,
and Kul&aacute;chi. It has a long river frontage
on the west, and is bounded on the east by
the Sulim&aacute;n Range. The Kachchh&iacute; of Dera Ismail
Kh&aacute;n corresponds to the Sindh of Dera Gh&aacute;zi Kh&aacute;n,

canals, except in the extreme north, where the Pah&aacute;rpur
Canal has recently been dug. It depends on floods and
wells. The D&aacute;man or "Skirt" of the hills is like the
Pach&aacute;dh of Dera Gh&aacute;z&iacute; Kh&aacute;n a broad expanse of strong
clayey loam or <i>pat</i> seamed by torrents and cultivated by
means of dams and embanked fields. The climate is
intensely hot in summer, and the average rainfall only
amounts to ten inches. Between one-fourth and one-fifth
of the area is cultivated. The Pach&aacute;dh is a camel-breeding

<p><b>Bannu.</b>&mdash;The small Bannu district occupies a basin
surrounded by hills and drained by the
Kurram and its affluent, the Toch&iacute;. It is
cut off from the Indus by the Isakhel <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>
of Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; and by a horn of the Dera
Ismail Kh&aacute;n district. Bannu is now connected with
K&aacute;lab&aacute;gh in Mianw&aacute;l&iacute; by a narrow gauge railway. An
extension of this line from Laki to T&aacute;nk in the Dera
Ismail Kh&aacute;n district has been sanctioned. There are two
<i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Bannu and Marwat. The cultivated area is about
one-half of the total area. About 30 p.c. of the cultivation
is protected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> by irrigation from small canals taking out of
the streams. Most of the irrigation is in the Bannu <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>.
The greater part of Marwat is a dry sandy tract yielding in
favourable seasons large crops of gram. But the harvests
on unirrigated land are precarious, for the annual rainfall
is only about 12 inches. The irrigated land in Bannu is
heavily manured and is often double-cropped. Wheat
accounts for nearly half of the whole crops of the district.
The Marwats are a frank manly race of good physique.
The Bann&uacute;ch&iacute;s are hard-working, but centuries of plodding
toil on a wet soil has spoiled their bodily development,
and had its share in imparting to their character qualities
the reverse of admirable. The Deputy Commissioner
has also political charge of some 17,884 tribesmen living
across the border. There are good metalled roads to
Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n and Koh&aacute;t, and also one on the Toch&iacute;
route.</p>

<p><b>Koh&aacute;t</b> is a large district, but most of it is unfit for
tillage and only one-sixth is actually cultivated.
The chief crops are wheat, 44, and
<i>b&aacute;jra</i>, 26 p.c. The district stretches east
and west for 100 miles from Khush&aacute;lgarh
on the Indus to Thal at the mouth of the Kurram valley.
The two places are now connected by a railway which
passes through the district headquarters at Koh&aacute;t
close to the northern border. There are three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>,
Koh&aacute;t, Hangu, and Ter&iacute;, the last a wild tract of bare
hills and ravines occupying the south of the district and
covering more than half its area. Two small streams,
the Koh&aacute;t Toi and the Ter&iacute; Toi, drain into the Indus.
The rainfall is fair, but very capricious. The cold weather
lasts long and the chill winds that blow during part of
it are very trying. The chief tribes are the Bangash
Path&aacute;ns of Hangu and the Khattak Path&aacute;ns of Ter&iacute;.
The Kh&aacute;n of Ter&iacute; is head of the Khattaks, a manly race<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
which sends many soldiers to our army. He enjoys the
revenue of the <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> subject to a quit rent of Rs. 20,000.</p>

<p><b>Hangu</b> contains in Upper and Lower Miranzai the most
fertile land in the district, but the culturable area of
the <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> is small and only one-tenth of it is under the
plough. Perennial streams run through the Miranzai
valleys, and the neighbouring hills support large flocks
of sheep and goats. Koh&aacute;t contains a number of salt
quarries, the most important being at Bah&aacute;dur Khel
near the Bannu border. The Thal subdivision consisting
of the Hangu <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> is in charge of an Assistant Commissioner
who manages our political relations with transfrontier
tribes living west of Fort Lockhart on the Sam&aacute;na
Range. The Deputy Commissioner is in direct charge of
the Pass Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s and the Jow&aacute;k&iacute;s and Orakzais in the
neighbourhood of Koh&aacute;t. He and his Assistant between
them look after our relations with 144,000 trans-border
Path&aacute;ns. The Sam&aacute;na Rifles, one of the useful irregular
corps which keep the peace of the Borderland, have their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>

<p><b>Pesh&aacute;war</b> is a large basin encircled by hills.  The
gorge of the Indus separates it from Attock
and Haz&aacute;ra. The basin is drained by the
K&aacute;bul river, whose chief affluents in Pesh&aacute;war
are the Sw&aacute;t and the B&aacute;ra.  The
district is divided into the five <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Pesh&aacute;war,
Charsadda, Naushahra, Mard&aacute;n, and Sw&aacute;b&iacute;. The last
two form the Mard&aacute;n subdivision. Nearly 40 p.c. of
the cultivation is protected by irrigation mainly from
canals large and small. The most important are the
Lower Sw&aacute;t, the K&aacute;bul River, and the B&aacute;ra River,
Canals. The irrigated area will soon be much increased
by the opening of the Upper Sw&aacute;t Canal. The cold
weather climate is on the whole pleasant, though too
severe in December and January. The three months
from August to October are a very unhealthy time. The
soil except in the stony lands near the hills is a fertile
loam. The cold weather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> rainfall is good, and the Spring
harvest is by far the more important of the two. Wheat
is the chief crop. Half of the people are Path&aacute;ns, the
rest are known generically as Hindk&iacute;s. The principal
Hindk&iacute; tribe is that of the Aw&aacute;ns. Besides managing his
own people the Deputy Commissioner has to supervise
our relations with 240,000 independent tribesmen across
the border. The Assistant Commissioner at Mard&aacute;n,
where the Corps of Guides is stationed, is in charge of our
dealings with the men of Buner and the Y&uacute;safzai border.
The N.W. Railway runs past the city of Pesh&aacute;war to
Jamr&uacute;d, and there is a branch line from Naushahra to
Dargai at the foot of the Malakand Pass.</p>

<p><b>Haz&aacute;ra</b> is a typical montane and submontane district with a copious
rainfall and a good climate. It has every kind of cultivation from
narrow terraced <i>kals&iacute;</i> fields built laboriously up steep mountain
slopes to very rich lands watered by canal cuts from the Dor or Haro.
Haz&aacute;ra is divided into three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i>, Haripur, Abbott&aacute;b&aacute;d, and
Mansehra. Between a fourth and a fifth of this area is culturable and
cultivated. In this crowded district the words are synonymous. The above
figure does not include the 204 square miles of Feudal Tan&aacute;wal. The
rainfall is copious and the crops generally speaking secure. The
principal are maize 42 and wheat 25 p.c. Haz&aacute;ra was part of the
territory made over to R&aacute;ja Gul&aacute;b Singh in 1846, but he handed it back
in exchange for some districts near Jammu. The maintenance of British
authority in Haz&aacute;ra in face of great odds by the Deputy Commissioner,
Captain James Abbott,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> during the Second Sikh War is a bright page in
Panj&aacute;b history, honourable alike to himself and his faithful local
allies. The population is as mixed as the soils. Path&aacute;ns are numerous,
but they are split up into small tribes. The Sw&aacute;t&iacute;s of Mansehra are the
most important section. After Path&aacute;ns G&uacute;jars and Aw&aacute;ns are the chief
tribes. The Gakkhars, though few in number, hold much land and a
dominant position in the Kh&aacute;npur tract on the R&aacute;walpind&iacute; border. The
Deputy Commissioner is also responsible for our relations with 98,000
trans-border tribesmen. The district is a wedge interposed between
Kashm&iacute;r on the east and Pesh&aacute;war and the tribal territory north of
Pesh&aacute;war on the west. The Indus becomes the border<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> about eight miles to
the north of Amb, and the district consists mainly of the areas drained
by its tributaries the Unh&aacute;r, Siran, Dor, and Haro. On the eastern side
the Jhelam is the boundary with Kashmir from Koh&aacute;la to a point below
Domel, where the Kunh&aacute;r meets it. Thence the Kunh&aacute;r is the boundary to
near Garh&iacute; Hab&iacute;bullah. To the south of Garh&iacute; the watershed of the Kunh&aacute;r
and Jhelam is close to these rivers and the country is very rough and
poor. West of Garh&iacute; it is represented by the chain which separates the
Kunh&aacute;r and Siran Valleys and ends on the frontier at Musa k&aacute; Musalla
(13,378 feet). This chain includes one peak over 17,000 feet, M&aacute;l&iacute; k&aacute;
Parvat, which is the highest in the district. The Kunh&aacute;r rises at the
top of the K&aacute;gan Glen, where it has a course of about 100 miles to
B&aacute;lakot. Here the glen ends, for the fall between B&aacute;lakot and Garh&iacute;
Hab&iacute;bullah is comparatively small. There is a good mule road from Garh&iacute;
Hab&iacute;bullah to the B&aacute;busar Pass at the top of the K&aacute;gan Glen, and beyond
it to Chil&aacute;s. There are rest-houses, some very small, at each stage from
B&aacute;lakot to Chil&aacute;s. The K&aacute;gan is a beautiful mountain glen. At places the
narrow road looks sheer down on the river hundreds of feet below,
rushing through a narrow gorge with the logs from the <i>deod&aacute;r</i> forests
tossing on the surface, and the sensation, it must be confessed, is not
wholly pleasant. But again it passes close to some quiet pretty stretch
of this same Kunh&aacute;r. There are side glens, one of which opposite Naran
contains the beautiful Safarmulk Lake. Near the top of the main glen the
Lulusar Lake at a height of 11,167 feet and with an average depth of 150
feet is passed on the left. In the lower part of the glen much maize is
grown. As one ascends almost the last crop to be seen is a coarse barley
sown in June and reaped in August. Where the trees and the crops end the
rich grass pastures begin. K&aacute;gan covers between one-third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> and
one-fourth of the whole district. The Siran flows through the beautiful
Bhogarmang Glen, at the foot of which it receives from the west the
drainage of the Konsh Glen. Forcing its way through the rough Tan&aacute;wal
hills, it leaves Feudal Tan&aacute;wal and Badhnak on its right, and finally
after its junction with the Dor flows round the north of the Gandgarh
Range and joins the Indus below Torbela. The bare Gandgarh Hills run
south from Torbela parallel with the Indus. The Dor rises in the hills
to the south of Abbott&aacute;b&aacute;d and drains the Haripur plain. A range of
rough hills divides the Dor valley from that of the Haro, which again is
separated from R&aacute;walpind&iacute; by the Kh&aacute;npur Range. To the west of the Siran
the Unh&aacute;r flows through Agror and Feudal Tan&aacute;wal, and joins the Indus a
little above Amb. Irrigation cuts are taken from all these streams, and
the irrigated cultivation is often of a very high character. The best
cultivation of the district is in the Haripur plain and the much smaller
Orash and Pakhl&iacute; plains and in the Haro valley. There is much
unirrigated cultivation in the first, and it is generally secure except
in the dry tract in the south-west traversed by the new railway from
Sarai K&aacute;la. The little Orash plain below Abbott&aacute;b&aacute;d is famous for its
maize and the Pakhl&iacute; plain for its rice.</p>

<p>Feudal Tan&aacute;wal is a very rough hilly country between the Siran on the
east and the Black Mountain and the river Indus on the west. It is the
appanage of the Kh&aacute;ns of Amb and Phulra.</p>

<p>North of Feudal Tan&aacute;wal is Agror. In 1891 the rights of the last Kh&aacute;n
were declared forfeit for abetment of raids by trans-bordermen.</p>

<p>There are fine forests in Haz&aacute;ra, but unfortunately the <i>deod&aacute;r</i> is
confined to the K&aacute;gan Glen and the Upper Siran. Nathiagal&iacute;, the summer
headquarters of the Chief Commissioner, is in the Dungagal&iacute; Range. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Serai K&aacute;la-Sr&iacute;nagar railway will run through Haz&aacute;ra. There is a good
mule road from Murree to Abbott&aacute;b&aacute;d through the Gal&iacute;s.</p>

<p>Feudal Tan&aacute;wal mentioned above occupies the southern corner of the tract
of independent tribal territory lying between the Haz&aacute;ra border and the
Indus. North of Tan&aacute;wal on the left bank of the river a long narrow
chain known as the Black Mountain rises in its highest peaks to a height
of nearly 10,000 feet. The western slopes are occupied by Hasanzais,
Akazais, and Chagarzais,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> who are Path&aacute;ns belonging to the great
Y&uacute;safzai clan, and these three sections also own lands on the right bank
of the Indus. They have been very troublesome neighbours to the British
Government. The eastern slopes of the Black Mountain are occupied by
Saiyyids and Sw&aacute;t&iacute;s, and the latter also hold the glens lying further
north, the chief of which is Allai.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">

</div>

<p>The mountainous tract on the Pesh&aacute;war border lying to the west of
Tan&aacute;wal and the territory of the Black Mountain tribes formed part of
the ancient Udy&aacute;na, and its archaeological remains are of much interest.
It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> drained by the Barandu, a tributary of the Indus. Its people are
mainly Y&uacute;safzai Path&aacute;ns, the principal section being the Bunerw&aacute;ls.
These last bear a good character for honesty and courage, but are slaves
to the teachings of their <i>mullas</i>. The Y&uacute;safzais have been bad
neighbours. The origin of the trouble is of old standing, dating back to
the welcome given by the tribesmen in 1824 to a band of Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute;
fanatics, whose leader was Saiyyid Ahmad Sh&aacute;h of Bareilly. Their
headquarters, first at Sit&aacute;na and afterwards at Malka, became Caves of
Adullam for political refugees and escaped criminals, and their
favourite pastime was the kidnapping of Hindu shopkeepers. In 1863 a
strong punitive expedition under Sir Neville Chamberlain suffered heavy
losses before it succeeded in occupying the Ambela Pass. The door being
forced the Y&uacute;safzais themselves destroyed Malka as a pledge of their
submission. Our political relations with the Y&uacute;safzais are managed by
the Assistant Commissioner at Mard&aacute;n.</p>

<p>The rest of the tribal territory between the Pesh&aacute;war district and the
Hindu Kush is included in the D&iacute;r, Sw&aacute;t, and Chitr&aacute;l political agency.
It is a region of mountains and valleys drained by the Sw&aacute;t, Panjkora,
and Chitr&aacute;l or Y&aacute;rkhun rivers, all three affluents of the K&aacute;bul river.
Six tracts are included in the Agency.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Sw&aacute;t.</b>&mdash;A railway now runs from Naushahra in the Pesh&aacute;war district
to Dargai, which lies at the foot of the Malakand, a little beyond our
administrative boundary. An old Buddhist road crosses the pass and
descends on the far side into Sw&aacute;t. We have a military post at Chakdarra
on the Sw&aacute;t river, and a military road passing through D&iacute;r connects
Chakdarra with Kila Drosh in Chitr&aacute;l. Most of the Sw&aacute;t&iacute;s, who are
Y&uacute;safzais of the Akozai section, occupy a rich valley above 70 miles in
length watered by the Sw&aacute;t river above its junction with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> the Panjkora.
Rice is extensively grown, and a malarious environment has affected the
physique and the character of the people. The Sw&aacute;t&iacute; is priest-ridden and
treacherous. Even his courage has been denied, probably unjustly. Sw&aacute;t&iacute;
fanaticism has been a source of much trouble on the Pesh&aacute;war border. The
last serious outbreak was in 1897, when a determined, but unsuccessful,
attack was made on our posts at Chakdarra and the Malakand Pass. The
Sw&aacute;t&iacute;s are Y&uacute;safzai Path&aacute;ns of the Akozai clan, and are divided into
five sections, one of which is known as R&aacute;n&iacute;zai.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Sam R&aacute;n&iacute;zai.</b>&mdash;A small tract between the Pesh&aacute;war border and the
hills is occupied by the Sam R&aacute;n&iacute;zais, who were formerly servants and
tenants of the R&aacute;n&iacute;zais, but are now independent.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Utm&aacute;n Khel.</b>&mdash;The country of the Utm&aacute;n Khels begins where the
Pesh&aacute;war boundary turns to the south. This tribe occupies the tract on
both sides of the Sw&aacute;t river to the west of Sw&aacute;t and Sam R&aacute;n&iacute;zai. On the
south-west the Sw&aacute;t river divides the Utm&aacute;n Khels from the Mohmands.
Their country is very barren, but a good many of them cultivate land in
the Pesh&aacute;war district. The Utm&aacute;n Khels are quite independent of the
surrounding tribes and have been troublesome neighbours to ourselves.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <b>Bajaur.</b>&mdash;Bajaur is a very mountainous tract lying to the
north-west of the Utm&aacute;n Khel country and between it and the Durand line.
It includes four valleys, through which flow the Rud river and its
affluents with the exception of that known as Jandol. The valley of the
last is now included in D&iacute;r. The Rud, also known as the Bajaur, is a
tributary of the Panjkora. The people consist mainly of Mamunds and
other sections of the Tarkanr&iacute; clan, which is related to the Y&uacute;safzais.
They own a very nominal allegiance to the Kh&aacute;n of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> Nawagai, who is
recognised as the hereditary head of the Tarkanr&iacute;s. They manage their
affairs in quasi-republican fashion through a council consisting of the
particular party which for the time being has got the upper hand.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <b>D&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;D&iacute;r is the mountainous country drained by the Panjkora and
its tributaries, to the north of its junction with the Rud river in
Bajaur. It is separated from Chitr&aacute;l by the Uchiri Range, which forms
the watershed of the Panjkora and Kunar rivers. The military road to
Kila Drosh crosses this chain by the Lowari Pass at a height of 10,200
feet. The people of D&iacute;r are mostly Y&uacute;safzais, relations of the Sw&aacute;t&iacute;s,
whom they much resemble in character. They pay one-tenth of their
produce to their overlord, the Kh&aacute;n of D&iacute;r, when he is strong enough to
take it. The higher parts of the country have a good climate and contain
fine <i>deod&aacute;r</i> forests. The Kh&aacute;n derives much of his income from the
export of timber, which is floated down the Panjkora and Sw&aacute;t rivers.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <b>Chitr&aacute;l.</b>&mdash;The Path&aacute;n country ends at the Lowari Pass. Beyond,
right up to the main axis of the Hindu Kush, is Chitr&aacute;l. It comprises
the basin of the Y&aacute;rkhun or Chitr&aacute;l river from its distant source in the
Shawar Shur glacier to Arnawai, where it receives from the west the
waters of the Bashgul, and is thenceforth known as the Kunar. Its
western boundary is the Durand line, which follows a lofty chain
sometimes called the K&aacute;firist&aacute;n range. Another great spur of the Hindu
Kush known as the Shandur range divides Chitr&aacute;l on the east from the
basin of the Yas&iacute;n river and the territories included in the Gilgit
Agency (see Chapter <span class="smcap">XXVIII</span>). Chitr&aacute;l is a fine country with a few
fertile valleys, good forests below 11,000 feet, and splendid, if
desolate, mountains in the higher ranges. The Chitr&aacute;l&iacute;s are a quiet
pleasure-loving people, fond of children and of dancing, hawking, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
polo. They are no cowards and no fanatics, but have little regard for
truth or good faith. The common language is Khow&aacute;r (see page <a href='#Page_112'><b>112</b></a>). The
chief, known as the Mehtar, has his headquarters at Chitr&aacute;l, a large
village on the river of the same name. It is dominated at a distance by
the great snow peak of Tirach M&iacute;r (see page <a href='#Page_22'><b>22</b></a>). The British garrison is
stationed at Kila Drosh on the river bank about halfway between Chitr&aacute;l
and the Lowari Pass<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Mohmands and Mallagor&iacute;s.</b>&mdash;South of the Utm&aacute;n Khel country and north of
the Khaibar are the rugged and barren hills held by that part of the
Mohmand tribe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> which lives inside the Durand line. The clan can muster
about 20,000 fighting men and is as convenient a neighbour as a nest of
hornets. The southern edge of the tract, where it abuts on the Khaibar,
is held by the little Mallagor&iacute; tribe, which is independent of the
Mohmands. Their country is important strategically because a route
passes through it by which the Khaibar can be outflanked. It is included
in the charge of the Political Agent for the Khaibar.</p>

<p><b>Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s.</b>&mdash;The pass and the tract lying to the south of it including the
Baz&aacute;r valley and part of Tirah are the home of the six sections of the
Pass Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s, the most important being the Zakha Khel, whose winter home
is in the Khaibar and the Baz&aacute;r valley, a barren glen hemmed in by
barren hills, the entrance to which is not far from Ali Masjid. Its
elevation is 3000 to 4000 feet. The valleys in Tirah proper, where the
Pass Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s for the most part spend the summer, are two or three
thousand feet higher. When the snow melts there is excellent pasturage.
The climate is pleasant in summer, but bitterly cold in winter. The B&aacute;ra
river with its affluents drains the glens of Tirah. The Aka Khel
Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s, who have no share in the Pass allowances, own a good dear of
land in the lower B&aacute;ra valley and winter in the adjoining hills. The
fighting strength of the above seven sections may be put at 21,000. When
they have been able to unite they have shown themselves formidable
enemies, for they are a strong and manly race, and they inhabit a very
difficult country<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. But the Afr&iacute;d&iacute; clan is torn by dissensions. Blood
feuds divide house from house, and the sections are constantly at feud
one with another. Apart from other causes of quarrel there is the
standing division into two great factions, Gar and Samil, which prevails
among Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s and Orakzais. Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s enlist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> freely in our regiments and
in the Khaibar Rifles, and have proved themselves excellent soldiers.
The eighth section of the Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s, the Adam Khel, who hold the Koh&aacute;t
Pass and the adjoining hills, have very little connection with the rest
of the clan. The Jow&aacute;k&iacute;s, against whom an expedition had to be sent in
the cold weather of 1877-78, are a sub-section of the Adam Khel.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 136. Khaibar Rifles.</span>
</div>


<p><b>Orakzais, Chamkann&iacute;s, and Zaimukhts.</b>&mdash;The Orakzais, who in numbers are
even stronger than the Pass and Aka Khel Afr&iacute;d&iacute;s, occupy the south of
Tirah, the Sam&aacute;n&aacute; Range on the border of Koh&aacute;t, and the valley of the
Kh&aacute;nk&iacute; river. The tribal territory extends westwards as far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> the
Khurmana, a tributary of the Kurram. The Orakzais do some trade and Sikh
<i>banias</i> and artizans are to be found in some of their villages. The
clan is honey-combed with feuds. North-west of the Orakzais beyond the
Khurmana are the Chamkann&iacute;s, and on the south is a small tribe of
vigorous mountaineers called Zaimukhts. One of these Zaimukhts, Sarwar
Kh&aacute;n, nicknamed Chikai, was a notorious frontier robber, and a person of
considerable importance on the border till his death in 1903.</p>

<p><b>The Kurram Valley.</b>&mdash;The Kurram Valley, which is drained by the Kurram
river and its affluents, lies to the south of the lofty Safed Koh range,
and reaches from Thal in Koh&aacute;t to the Peiwar Kotal on the borders of
Afgh&aacute;n Khost. It has an area of nearly 1300 square miles and in 1911 the
population was estimated at 60,941 souls. Though under British
administration, it does not form a part of any British district. The
people are Path&aacute;ns of various clans, the predominant element being the
Tur&iacute;s, who are Shias by religion and probably of Turkish origin. It was
at their request that the valley was annexed in 1892. The political
agent has his headquarters at Parachin&aacute;r in Upper Kurram, which is
divided from Lower Kurram by a spur of the Khost hills, through which
the river has cut a passage. Such part of the Indian penal law as is
suitable has been introduced, and civil rights are governed by the
customary law of the Tur&iacute;s. A complete record of rights in land and
water has been framed, and the land revenue demand is 88,000 rupees
(&pound;5889). Upper Kurram is a wide and fertile valley set in a frame of
pine-clad hills. It is not fully cultivated, but has great
possibilities, especially in the matter of fruit growing. The snowfall
is heavy in winter, but the summer climate is excellent. Lower Kurram is
a poor and narrow glen unpleasantly hot and cold according to the season
of the year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> Parachin&aacute;r is connected with the railhead at Thal by a
good <i>tonga</i> road.</p>

<p><b>Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n.</b>&mdash;The country of the Darwesh Khel and Mahsud Waz&iacute;rs extends
from the Kurram valley to the Gomal river. It is divided into the North
Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n (2300 square miles) and the South Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n (2700 square
miles) Agencies. North Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n consists of four valleys and some
barren plateaux. The principal valley is that of Daur (700 square miles)
drained by the Toch&iacute;. In 1894 the Dauris sought refuge from Darwesh Khel
inroads by asking for British administration. In the eyes of the Darwesh
Khel they are a race of clodhoppers. Their sole virtue consists in
patient spade industry in the stiff rich soil of their valley, their
vices are gross, and their fanaticism is extreme. The political agent's
headquarters are at Miram Shah. South Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n is the home of the
troublesome Mahsuds, who can muster 11,000 fighting men. But parts of
the country, e.g. the W&aacute;na plain, are held by the Darwesh Khel. Much of
South Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n consists of bare hills and valleys and stony plains
scored with torrents, which are dry most of the year. The streams are
salt. Part of the hinterland is however a more inviting tract with
grassy uplands and hills clad with oak, pine, and <i>deod&aacute;r</i>. W&aacute;na, where
the political agent has his headquarters, was occupied on the invitation
of the Darwesh Khel in 1894.</p>

<p><b>Sher&aacute;n&iacute;s.</b>&mdash;The Sher&aacute;n&iacute; country stretches along the Dera Ismail Kh&aacute;n
border from the Gomal to the Vihoa torrent. The L&aacute;rgha or lower part has
been under direct administration since 1899, the Upper part belongs to
the Biluchist&aacute;n Agency.</p>

<p><b>Tribal Militias.</b>&mdash;In the greater part of India beyond the border there
is no British administration. Respect for our authority and the peace of
the roads are upheld,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> and raiding on British territory is restrained,
by irregular forces raised from among the tribesmen. There are Hunza and
Nagar levies, Chitr&aacute;l and D&iacute;r levies, Khaibar Rifles, Sam&aacute;na Rifles, and
Kurram, North Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n, and South Waz&iacute;rist&aacute;n militias.</p>

<h3>KASHM&Iacute;R AND JAMMU</h3>


<p><b>Kashm&iacute;r.</b>&mdash;Some account has already been given of the topography and
scenery of the wide territory, covering an area about equal to that of
the Panj&aacute;b less the Amb&aacute;la division, ruled by the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja of Kashm&iacute;r
and Jammu. The population, races, languages, and religions have been
referred to in Chapters <span class="smcap">IX</span> and <span class="smcap">X</span>.</p>

<p><b>Modern history.</b>&mdash;Some mention has been made of the early history of
Kashm&iacute;r (pages 165, 166, 172, 173). Even the hard Sikh rule was a relief
to a country which had felt the tyranny of the Dur&aacute;n&iacute; governors who
succeeded the Moghals. Under the latter small kingships had survived in
the Jammu hills, but the Jammuw&aacute;l Rajas met at Ranj&iacute;t Singh's hands the
same fate as the K&aacute;ngra R&aacute;jas. Three cadets of the Jammu royal house,
the brothers Dhi&aacute;n Singh, Suchet Singh, and Gul&aacute;b Singh, were great men
at his court. In 1820 he made the last R&aacute;ja of Jammu. Gul&aacute;b Singh was a
man fit for large designs. In 20 years he had made himself master of
Bhadr&aacute;wah, Kishtw&aacute;r, Lad&aacute;kh, and B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n, and held the casket which
enclosed the jewel of Kashm&iacute;r. He acquired the jewel itself for 75 lakhs
by treaty with the British at the close of the first Sikh war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>Excluding a large but little-known and almost uninhabited tract beyond
the Muztagh and Karakoram mountains, the drainage of which is northwards
into Central Asia, the country consists of the valleys of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> Chen&aacute;b,
Jhelam, and Indus, that of the last amounting to three-fourths of the
whole. There is a trifling area to the west of Jammu, which contains the
head-waters of small streams which find their way into the R&aacute;v&iacute;.</p>

<p><b>Chen&aacute;b Valley.</b>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Plain and Kand&iacute;.</i> This tract extends from M&iacute;rpur
on the Jhelam to Kathua near the R&aacute;v&iacute; and close to the head-works of the
Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal at M&aacute;dhopur. It is coterminous with the Panj&aacute;b
districts of Jhelam, Gujr&aacute;t, Si&aacute;lkot, and Gurd&aacute;spur, and comprises four
of the five districts of the Jammu Province, M&iacute;rpur, Ri&aacute;s&iacute;, Jammu, and
Jasrota, and a part of the fifth, Udhampur. The plain is moist and
unhealthy. The rough country behind with a stony and thirsty red soil
covered in its natural state with <i>garna</i> (Carissa spinarum), <i>sanatan</i>
(Dodonaea viscosa), and <i>bhekar</i> (Adhatoda vasica) does not suffer in
this respect. The chief crops of the Kand&iacute; are wheat, barley, and rape
in the spring, and maize and <i>b&aacute;jra</i> in the autumn, harvest. Behind the
Kand&iacute; is a higher and better tract, including Naoshera, with wide
valleys, in which maize replaces <i>b&aacute;jra</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Uplands.</i> The greater part of the Upper Chen&aacute;b Valley is occupied
by Kishtw&aacute;r and <i>Jag&iacute;r</i> Bhadr&aacute;wah. The rainfall is heavy and there is
copious irrigation from <i>kuhls</i> (page <a href='#Page_142'><b>142</b></a>), but elevation and rapid
drainage make the climate healthy. In the upper parts snow and cold
winds sometimes prevent the ripening of the crops. The poppy is grown in
Kishtw&aacute;r and Bhadr&aacute;wah. Kishtw&aacute;r is a part of the Udhampur district.</p>

<p><b>Jhelam Valley.</b>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Vale of Kashm&iacute;r with adjoining glens and
mountains.</i> This first division of the Jhelam Valley extends from the
source above Vern&aacute;g to B&aacute;ram&uacute;la, and embraces not only the Vale of
Kashm&iacute;r, over 80 miles long and from 20 to 25 miles in breadth, but the
glens which drain into it and the mountains that surround<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> it. It
therefore includes cultivation of all sorts from rich irrigated rice
fields to narrow plots terraced up mountain slopes on which buckwheat
and the beardless Tibetan barley are grown. The administrative divisions
are the <i>waz&aacute;rat</i> or district of South Kashmir and the southern part of
North Kashm&iacute;r. The central valley has an elevation of 6000 feet. It was
undoubtedly once a lake bed. Shelving fan-shaped "<i>karewas</i>" spread out
into it from the bases of the hills. The object of the Kashm&iacute;r&iacute; is to
raise as much rice as he possibly can on the alluvium of his valley and
on the rich soil deposited on the banks of mountain streams. Manure and
facilities for irrigation exist in abundance, and full use is made of
them in the cultivation of the favourite crop. <i>Kangn&iacute;</i> takes the place
of rice in many fields if there is any deficiency of water. On reclaimed
swamps near the Jhelam heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> crops of maize are raised. The tillage for
wheat and barley is as careless as that for rice is careful. The
cultivation of saffron (Crocus sativus) on <i>karewas</i> is famous, but the
area is now limited, as the starving people ate up the bulbs in the
great famine of 1877 and recovery is slow. Saffron is used as a pigment
for the sectarian marks on the forehead of the orthodox Hindu and also
as a condiment. The little floating vegetable gardens on the Dal lake
are a very curious feature. The "<i>demb</i>" lands on the borders of the
same lake are a rich field for the market gardener's art. He fences a
bit of land with willows, and deposits on it weeds and mud from the lake
bed. He is of the boatman or Hanz caste, whose reputation is by no means
high, and can himself convey by water his vegetables and fruits to the
Sr&iacute;nagar market. The production of fruit in Kashm&iacute;r is very large, and
the extension of the railway to Sr&iacute;nagar should lead to much improvement
in the quality and in the extent of the trade. It may also improve the
prospects of sericulture.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Jhelam Gorge and Valley of Kishnganga.</i> The Jhelam gorge below
B&aacute;ram&uacute;la is narrow and the cultivation is usually terraced. The
Kishnganga joins the Jhelam near Muzaffar&aacute;b&aacute;d. The Muzaffar&aacute;b&aacute;d district
includes the Jhelam gorge and the lower part of the valley of the
Kishnganga. The upper part is in the Uttarmachhipura <i>tahs&iacute;l</i> of the
district of North Kashm&iacute;r.</p>

<p><b>Indus Valley.</b>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Lad&aacute;kh including Z&aacute;nskar and Rupshu.</i> Some
description of Lad&aacute;kh and its scenery has already been given in Chapter
II. It may be divided into Rupshu, Z&aacute;nskar, and Lad&aacute;kh proper with Leh
as its centre. Rupshu in the south-east is a country of great brackish
lakes in no part less than 13,500 feet above sea level. At such a height
cultivation must be very difficult, but a little beardless Tibetan
barley is raised. The scanty population consists mainly of nomad
shepherds. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> Lad&aacute;kh the people are divided into shepherds or
<i>champas</i>, who roam over the Alpine pastures, and Lad&aacute;kh&iacute;s, who till
laboriously every available patch of culturable land in the river
valleys. Though both are Buddhists they rarely intermarry. Z&aacute;nskar to
the N.W. of Rupshu is drained by the river of the same name, which flows
northwards to join the Indus below Leh. It forms part of the Kargil
<i>tahs&iacute;l</i>. Z&aacute;nskar is a bleak inaccessible region where the people and
cattle remain indoors for six months of the year. Its breed of ponies is
famous. In Lad&aacute;kh proper cultivation ranges from 9000 to 15,000 feet.
The sandy soil must be manured and irrigated, and is often refreshed by
top-dressings of fresh earth from the hill sides. The crops are wheat
and barley, rape, lucerne, peas and beans, in spring, and buckwheat,
millets, and turnips, in autumn. There is a great lack of wood for
building and for fuel, and the deficiency in the latter case has to be
supplied by cow-dung cakes. Notwithstanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> their hard life the people
are cheerful and fairly well off, for polyandry has prevented
overcrowding.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 141. Lad&aacute;kh Hills.</span>
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n.</i> In B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n, which lies to the N.W. of Lad&aacute;kh, they
are Muhammadans and there is much more pressure on the soil. They are a
cheery race and very fond of polo. To support their families the men
have to work as carriers on the roads to Leh and Gilgit. They tend the
cattle in the pastures, keep the irrigation channels and the walls of
the terraced fields in repair, and do the ploughing. The rest of the
work of cultivation is left to the women. The climate is very severe and
most of the rivers are frozen in winter. On the other hand near the
Indus on the Skardo plain (7250 feet) and in the Rondu gorge further
west, the heat is intense in July and August. The dreary treeless stony
Deosai Plains on the road to Kashm&iacute;r have an elevation of 13,000 feet.
The cultivation and crops are much the same as in Lad&aacute;kh. Excellent
fruit is grown, and there is a considerable export of apricots. Gold
washing is carried on with profit.</p>

<p>Lad&aacute;kh and B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n together form the Lad&aacute;kh <i>waz&aacute;rat</i>, divided into
the three <i>tahs&iacute;ls</i> of Lad&aacute;kh, Kargil, and Skardo.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Astor and Gilgit.</i>&mdash;Where the Gilgit road from Kashm&iacute;r descends
from the Burzil pass (13,500 feet) the country of Astor is reached. It
is drained by the Astor river, which joins the Indus to the south of
Bunj&iacute;. The bridge which crosses it at Ramgh&aacute;t is only 3800 feet above
sea level. The village of Astor itself is at a height of 7853 feet. The
cultivation is of the same description as that in B&aacute;ltist&aacute;n.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> The aspect
of the country is bleak till the Indus is crossed, and Gilgit (4890
feet) is reached. Here there is a fertile well-watered oasis from which
on every side great mountain peaks are visible. The lands are heavily
manured. Rice, maize, millet, buckwheat, cotton, wheat, barley, rape,
and lucerne are grown. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> is a second and easier road to Gilgit
from India over the B&aacute;busar pass at the top of the K&aacute;gan Glen in Haz&aacute;ra.
But the posts are sent by the Kashm&iacute;r road. The Astor&iacute;s and Gilgit&iacute;s are
a simple easy-going folk, and, like the B&aacute;lt&iacute;s, very fond of polo. A
British Political Agent is stationed at Gilgit. He is responsible to the
Government of India for the administration of Hunza, Nagar, and Yas&iacute;n,
and of the little republics in the neighbourhood of Chil&aacute;s. Hunza and
Nagar lie to the north of Gilgit near the junction of the Muztagh and
Hindu Kush ranges, and Yas&iacute;n far to the west about the upper waters of
the Gilgit river.</p>

</div>

<p>In Astor and Gilgit also Gul&aacute;b Singh's Dogras replaced the Sikh troops.
But across the Indus Gul&aacute;b Singh was never strong, and after 1852 that
river was his boundary. He died in 1857, having proved himself a hard
and unscrupulous, but a capable and successful ruler. His son, Randh&iacute;r
Singh, was a better man, but a worse king. A good Hindu, tolerant, and a
friend of learning, he had not the force of character to control the
corrupt official class, and the people suffered much in consequence. He
was a loyal ally in the Mutiny. In 1860 his forces recovered Gilgit, a
conquest which for years after was a fruitful source of suffering to his
Cis-Indus subjects. The present Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja, Sir Prat&aacute;p Singh, G.C.S.I.,
succeeded in 1885. While he lived his brother, R&aacute;ja Amar Singh, played a
very important part in Kashm&iacute;r affairs. From 1887 to 1905 the
administration was managed by a small council, of which after 1891 the
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja was President and R&aacute;ja Amar Singh Vice-President. It was
abolished in 1905. There are now under the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja a chief minister and
ministers in charge of the home and revenue departments. Judicial
business is controlled by the Judge of the High Court. Death sentences
must be confirmed by the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja. The highest executive officers are
the governors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> of Jammu and Kashm&iacute;r, and the <i>Waz&iacute;rs Waz&aacute;rat</i> of Lad&aacute;kh
and Gilgit. In Jammu and Kashm&iacute;r each of the eight districts is in
charge of a <i>Waz&iacute;r Waz&aacute;rat</i>. In connection with the land revenue
settlement, forests, etc., the services of British officers have been
lent to the State. The Government of India is represented at Sr&iacute;nagar by
a Resident, and a political agent at Gilgit exercises a general
supervision over the <i>Waz&iacute;r Waz&aacute;rat</i>.</p>

<p>During the reign of the present Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja great reforms have been
effected. The construction of the Gilgit road has done away with the
blood tax, which the conveyance of supplies to that remote post formerly
involved. The land revenue settlement has largely substituted cash for
kind payments and done away with many abuses. Official corruption and
oppression have been scotched, but would speedily revive if vigilance
were relaxed. The different peoples ruled by the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja are easily
governed if properly treated, and violent crime is rare.</p>

<h3>CITIES</h3>


<p><b>Delhi</b> (28.38 N., 77.13 E.).&mdash;Of imperial cities the most interesting are
those which have felt the tragedies as well as enjoyed the glories of
Empire. From this point of view Delhi, notwithstanding its small extent
and modern foundation, may be grouped with Rome, Constantinople, and
Paris. In the matter of size it is in the same class as Edinburgh. The
present Delhi or Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n&aacute;b&aacute;d is a creation of the middle of the
seventeenth century, and the oldest of the Delhis in the neighbourhood
goes back only to the fourth century of our era. The latter endured for
six or seven centuries. It was the capital of the Tunwar and Chauh&aacute;n
R&aacute;jas, and takes its second name of Rai Pithora's Kila' or Fort from the
last Hindu King of Delhi, the famous Prithv&iacute; R&aacute;ja. The early Muhammadan
kings occupied it and adorned it with splendid buildings. Firoz Sh&aacute;h
Tughlak's city of Firoz&aacute;b&aacute;d occupied part of the present Delhi and the
country lying immediately to the south of it. The other so-called towns
Sir&iacute;, Tughlak&aacute;b&aacute;d, and Indarpat or Pur&aacute;n&aacute; Kila' (Old Fort) were
fortified royal residences round which other dwelling-houses and shops
sprang up.</p>

<p>The visitor to Delhi will be repaid if he can devote a week to the City
and the neighbourhood. It is impossible here to give any adequate
account of the objects of historic and architectural interest. No
visitor should be without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> Mr H. C. Fanshawe's <i>Delhi Past and Present</i>,
a work of great interest. The value of the text is enhanced by good maps
and excellent illustrations. In the Civil Station, which lies to the
north of the City and east of the Ridge, is Ludlow Castle, from the roof
of which General Wilson and his Staff watched the assault on 14th
September, 1857, when Delhi was retaken. Ludlow Castle is now the Delhi
Club. Between it and the northern rampart of the City, a defence against
the Mahrattas built by British officers fifty years earlier, grim
fighting took place on that historic day when the little British and
Indian force, till then rather besieged than besiegers, was at last
strong enough to attack. Here are the sites of the four batteries which
breached that rampart, and here is the grave of John Nicholson and the
statue recently erected in his honour (page <a href='#Page_190'><b>190</b></a>). The Ridge to which the
little army had clung obstinately from May to September in scorching
heat and drenching rain, undismayed by repeated assaults and the ravages
of cholera, starts about half-a-mile to the west of the Mor&iacute; bastion, at
the north-west corner of the city wall, and runs north by east to
Waz&iacute;r&aacute;b&aacute;d on an old bed of the Jamna. Ascending to the Flagstaff Tower
one looks down to-day on the Circuit House and the site of the principal
camps at the great <i>darb&aacute;r</i> of 1911. Here was the old Cantonment and its
parade ground, on which the main encampment of the British force stood
in 1857. The position was strong, being defended by the ridge on the
east and the Najafgarh Canal on the west. It is open to the south, where
are the Savz&iacute; Mand&iacute; (Vegetable Market), now the site of factories, and
the Roshan&aacute;ra Gardens. It was on this side that the mutineers made their
most dangerous attacks. The road along the Ridge from the Flagstaff
Tower passes the Chauburj&iacute; Mosque and Hindu Rao's house, which was the
principal target of the City batteries and was gallantly held by Major
Reid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> with his Sirmur Gurkhas, the Guides, and the 60th Rifles. Beyond
Hindu Rao's house is one of the stone pillars of A&#351;oka, which Firoz
Sh&aacute;h Tughlak transported to Delhi. Still further south is the Mutiny
Memorial. As one reads the tale of the losses of the different regiments
one realizes in some measure the horrors and the heroism of which the
Ridge was witness.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 144. Kashm&iacute;r Gate.</span>
</div>
<p><b>The City.</b>&mdash;When visiting the City from the Civil Lines it is well to
follow the road, which passing the Kudsia Gardens leads straight to the
Kashm&iacute;r Gate, one of two places in India (the Lucknow Residency is the
other) which must stir with grateful pride the heart of the most
phlegmatic of Englishmen. The road from the Gate to the Fort and the
Jama Masjid is rich in memories of the Mutiny. It has on its left S.
James' Church, with memorial tablets within and outside the shot-riddled
globe which once surmounted its dome. Further on are the obelisk to the
telegraph officers who stuck to their posts on the fatal 11th of May,
and on a gateway of the Old Magazine a record of the heroism of the nine
devoted men, who blew it up, losing five of their number in the
explosion. Passing under the railway bridge one comes out on the open
space in front of Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n's palace fort, which was finished about 1648
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> To the beautiful buildings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> erected by his father Aurangzeb added
the little Mot&iacute; Masjid or Pearl Mosque. But he never lived at Delhi
after 1682. The palace is therefore associated with the tragedies and
squalor of the decline and fall of the Moghal Empire rather than with
its glories. In 1739 it was robbed of the Kohinur and the Peacock throne
by N&aacute;dir Shah, in 1788 it saw the descendants of Akbar tortured and the
aged Emperor blinded by the hateful Ghul&aacute;m K&aacute;dir, and on 16th May, 1857
the mutineers massacred fifty Christians captive within its walls. When
viewing the public and private halls of audience, known as the Diw&aacute;n i
'&Aacute;m and the Diw&aacute;n i Kh&aacute;ss, it is however natural to think rather of
scenes of splendour such as Bernier described when Aurangzeb sat in
royal apparel on the Peacock throne with a king's ransom in the aigrette
of his turban and the rope of pearls which hung from his neck. On such
an occasion, the pillars of the Diw&aacute;n i '&Aacute;m were hung with gold brocades
and the floors covered with rich silken carpets. Half the court outside
was occupied by a magnificent tent and the arcade galleries surrounding
it were decked with brocades and covered with costly carpets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> The marble
Diw&aacute;n i Kh&aacute;ss with its lovely pillars decorated with gold and precious
stones is surely the most splendid withdrawing room that a monarch ever
possessed. There is nothing in the Moorish palace at Granada which can
for a moment be compared with these two halls. For a description of them
and of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> other buildings in the Fort the reader must refer to Mr
Fanshawe's book. In the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon and since much has
been done to restore their surroundings to some semblance of their
former state. But the heavy British barracks occupied by the little
garrison are very incongruous with the remains of Moghal grandeur.
Leaving the Fort by the Southern or Delhi Gate and turning to the right
one is faced by the Jama Masjid, another monument of the taste of
Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n. The gateway and the lofty ascent into this House of God are
very fine. The mosque in the regular beauty and grandeur of its lines,
appealing to the sublimity rather than to the mystery of religion, is a
fitting symbol of the faith for whose service it was raised. South of
the Jama Masjid in a part of the city once included in Firoz&aacute;b&aacute;d stands
the Kal&aacute;n or K&aacute;la Masjid with low cupolas and heavy square black
pillars, a striking example of the sombre architecture of the Tughlak
period. A narrow street called the Dar&iacute;ba leads from the Jama Masjid to
the wide Ch&aacute;ndn&iacute; (Silver) Chauk. The Dar&iacute;ba was formerly closed by the
Kh&uacute;n&iacute; Darw&aacute;za or Gate of Blood, so called because here occurred that
terrible massacre of the citizens of Delhi which N&aacute;dir Shah witnessed
from the neighbouring Golden Mosque. Besides its width there is nothing
remarkable about the Ch&aacute;ndn&iacute; Chauk. But the visitor in quest of silver
work, jewellery, or embroidery will find there many shopkeepers ready to
cater for his wants. It was while passing down the Ch&aacute;ndn&iacute; Chauk in an
elephant procession on 23rd December, 1912, that Lord Hardinge was
wounded by a bomb thrown from one of the houses. From the Chauk one may
pass through the Queen's Gardens and Road to the opening in the wall
where the K&aacute;bul Gate once stood and so leave the City. A tablet in the
vicinity marks the spot where John Nicholson fell.</p>

</div>

<p>When visiting the old Delhis it is a good plan to drive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> again through
the City and to leave it by the Delhi Gate. Hum&aacute;yun's tomb, an early and
simple, but striking, specimen of Moghal architecture, is reached at a
distance of four miles along the Mathra road. Outside the City the road
first leaves on the left side the ruined citadel of Firoz Sh&aacute;h
containing the second A&#351;oka pillar. North and south of this citadel
the town of Firoz&aacute;b&aacute;d once lay. It ended where the Pur&aacute;n&aacute; Kila' or Old
Fort, the work of Sher Sh&aacute;h and Hum&aacute;yun, now stands, a conspicuous
object from the road about three miles from Delhi. The red sandstone
gateway very narrow in proportion to its height is a noble structure,
and within the walls is Sher Sh&aacute;h's mosque. The fort and mosque are the
last important works of the second or Tughlak period. Hindus call the
site of the Old Fort, Indarpat. If any part of Delhi has a claim to
antiquity it is this, for it is alleged to be one of the five "pats" or
towns over which the war celebrated in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata was waged. A
recent cleaning of part of the interior of the fort brought to light
bricks belonging to the Gupta period. From Hum&aacute;yun's tomb a cross road
leads to the Gurg&aacute;on road and the Kutb. But the visitor who has seen
enough of buildings for the day may proceed further down the Mathra road
and reach the headworks of the Agra Canal at Okhla by a side road. The
view looking back to Delhi up the Jamna is fine.</p>

<p><b>The Kutb Min&aacute;r.</b>&mdash;Starting for the Kutb from Hum&aacute;yun's tomb (page <a href='#Page_207'><b>207</b></a>)
the Darg&aacute;h of the great Chist&iacute; saint and political intriguer, Niz&aacute;m ud
d&iacute;n Aulia, is passed on the left. He died in 1324 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Just at the point
where the cross road meets the Gurg&aacute;on road is the tomb of Safdar Jang,
the second of the Naw&aacute;b Waz&iacute;rs of Oudh. He died after the middle of the
eighteenth century, and the building is wonderfully good considering
that it is one of the latest important monuments of the Moghal period.
Six miles to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> the south of Safdar Jang's tomb the entrance to the Kutb
Min&aacute;r enclosure is reached. The great Kuwwat ul Isl&aacute;m mosque of
Kutbudd&iacute;n Aibak (page 204) was constructed out of the materials of a
Jain temple which stood on the site. Evidence of this is to be found in
the imperfectly defaced sculptures on the pillars. An iron pillar nearly
24 feet in height dating back probably to the sixth century stands in
the court. The splendid column known as the Kutb Min&aacute;r (page <a href='#Page_205'><b>205</b></a>), begun
by Kutbudd&iacute;n and completed by his successor Shams ud d&iacute;n Altamsh, was
the minaret of the mosque from which the <i>mu'azzin</i> called the faithful
to prayer. The disappointment that may be felt when it is seen from a
distance is impossible on a nearer view. Its height is now 238 feet, but
it was formerly surmounted "by a majestic cupola of red granite." Close
by is the Alai Darwaza, a magnificent gateway built by Al&aacute; ud d&iacute;n
Tughlak in 1310, about 90 years after the Min&aacute;r was finished. Five miles
east of the Kutb are the cyclopean ruins of Tughlak&aacute;b&aacute;d (page <a href='#Page_206'><b>206</b></a>).</p>

<p><b>Delhi past and present.</b>&mdash;The Delhi of Aurangzeb was as much a camp as a
city. When the Emperor moved to Agra or Kashm&iacute;r the town was emptied of
a large part of its inhabitants. It contained one or two fine <i>baz&aacute;rs</i>,
and nobles and rich merchants and shopkeepers had good houses, set
sometimes in pleasant gardens. But the crowds of servants and followers
occupied mud huts, whose thatched roofs led to frequent and widespread
fires. In that insanitary age these may have been blessings in disguise.
"In Delhi," wrote Bernier, "there is no middle state. A man must either
be of the highest rank or live miserably.... For two or three who wear
decent apparel there may always be reckoned seven or eight poor, ragged,
and miserable beings." The ordinary street architecture of modern Delhi
is mean enough, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> posterity will not open an eyelid to look at the
public buildings which its present rulers have erected in the city. But
at least the common folk of Delhi are better housed, fed, and clad than
ever before. It is now a clean well-managed town with a good water
supply, and it has become an important railway centre and a thriving
place of trade. Since 1881 the population has steadily increased from
173,393 to 232,837 in 1911. In 1911-12 the imports into Delhi City from
places outside the Panj&aacute;b amounted to 9,172,302 maunds. There are some
fifteen cotton ginning, spinning, and weaving mills, besides flour
mills, iron foundries, two biscuit manufactories, and a brewery. The
city is well supplied with hospitals including two for women only.
Higher education has been fostered by S. Stephen's College in charge of
the Cambridge Missionary brotherhood. The Hindu college has not been
very successful. Delhi has had famous "hak&iacute;ms," practising the Y&uacute;n&aacute;ni or
Arabic system of medicine, which is taught in a flourishing school known
as the Madrasa i Tibbiya.</p>

<p><b>Imperial Darb&aacute;rs.</b>&mdash;In this generation the plain to the north of the
Ridge has been the scene of three splendid <i>darb&aacute;rs</i>. When on 1st
January, 1877, Queen Victoria assumed the title of Empress of India
(<i>Kaisar i Hind</i>) it seemed fitting that the proclamation of the fact to
the princes and peoples of India should be made by Lord Lytton at the
old seat of imperial power. On 1st January, 1903, Lord Curzon held a
<i>darb&aacute;r</i> on the same spot to proclaim the coronation of King Edward the
VIIth. Both these splendid ceremonies were surpassed by the <i>darb&aacute;r</i> of
12th December, 1911, when King George and Queen Mary were present in
person, and the Emperor received the homage of the ruling chiefs, the
great officials, and the leading men of the different provinces. The
King and Queen entered Delhi on 7th December, and in the week that
followed the craving of the Indian peoples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> for "<i>darshan</i>" or a sight
of their sovereign was abundantly gratified. None who saw the spectacles
of that historic week will ever forget them.</p>

<p>New Imperial Capital.&mdash;The turn of Fortune's Wheel has again made Delhi
an imperial city. The transfer of the seat of government from Calcutta
announced by the King Emperor at the <i>darb&aacute;r</i>, is now being carried out.
The site will probably extend from Safdar Jang's tomb to a point lying
to the west of Firoz Sh&aacute;h's citadel.</p>

<p><b>Lahore</b> (31.34 N., 74.21 E.). The capital of the Panj&aacute;b lies on the east
bank of the R&aacute;v&iacute;, which once flowed close to the Fort, but has moved a
mile or two to the west. In high floods the waters still spread over the
lowlands between the R&aacute;v&iacute; and the Fort. Lahore lies nearly halfway
between Delhi and Pesh&aacute;war, being nearer to the latter than to the
former.</p>

<p><b>Early History.</b>&mdash;Practically we know nothing of its history till Mahm&uacute;d
conquered the Panj&aacute;b and put a garrison in a fort at Lahore. Henceforth
its history was intimately connected with Muhammadan rule in India.
Whether north-western India was ruled from Ghazn&iacute; or from Delhi, the
chief provincial governor had his headquarters at Lahore. In the best
days of Moghal rule<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> Agra and Lahore were the two capitals of the
Empire. Lahore lay on the route to K&aacute;bul and Kashm&iacute;r, and it was
essential both to the power and to the pleasures of the Emperors that it
should be strongly held and united to Delhi and Agra by a Royal or
<i>B&aacute;dsh&aacute;h&iacute;</i> Road. The City and the Suburbs in the reign of Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n
probably covered three or four times the area occupied by the town in
the days of Sikh rule. All round the city are evidences of its former
greatness in ruined walls and domes.</p>

<p><b>The Civil Station.</b>&mdash;The An&aacute;rkal&iacute; gardens and the buildings near them
mark the site of the first Civil Station. John Lawrence's house, now
owned by the R&aacute;ja of Punch, is beyond the Chauburj&iacute; on the Mult&aacute;n Road.
The Civil Lines have stretched far to the south-east in the direction of
the Cantonment, which till lately took its name from the tomb of Mian
M&iacute;r, Jahang&iacute;r's spiritual master. The soil is poor and arid. Formerly
the roads were lined with dusty tamarisks. But of late better trees have
been planted, and the Mall is now quite a fine thoroughfare. The
Lawrence Hall Gardens and the grounds of Government House show what can
be done to produce beauty out of a bad soil when there is no lack of
water. There is little to praise in the architecture or statuary of
modern Lahore. The marble canopy over Queen Victoria's statue is however
a good piece of work. Of the two cathedrals the Roman Catholic is the
better building. The Montgomery Hall with the smaller Lawrence Hall
attached, a fine structure in a good position in the public gardens, is
the centre of European social life in Lahore. Government House is close
by, on the opposite side of the Mall. Its core, now a unique and
beautiful dining-room with domed roof and modern oriental decoration, is
the tomb of Muhammad K&aacute;sim Kh&aacute;n, a cousin of Akbar. Jamad&aacute;r Khush&aacute;l
Singh, a well-known man in Ranj&iacute;t Singh's reign, built a house round the
tomb. After annexation, Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> Lawrence occupied it for a time, and Sir
Robert Montgomery adopted it as Government House. It is now much
transformed. Beyond Government House on the road to the Cantonment are
the Club and the Panj&aacute;b Chiefs' College, the only successful attempt in
Lahore to adapt oriental design to modern conditions.</p>

<p><b>The Indian City.</b>&mdash;In its streets and <i>baz&aacute;rs</i> Lahore is a truly eastern
city, and far more interesting than Delhi, so far as private buildings
are concerned. In public edifices it possesses some fine examples of
Moghal architecture. Every visitor should drive through the town to the
Fort past Waz&iacute;r Kh&aacute;n's mosque. Under British rule the height of the city
wall has been reduced by one-half and the moat filled in and converted
into a garden. Waz&iacute;r Kh&aacute;n's mosque founded in 1634 by a Panj&aacute;b&iacute;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
minister of Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n, is a noble building profusely adorned with glazed
tiles and painted panels. The Golden Mosque was constructed 120 years
later about the same time as Safdar Jang's tomb at Delhi. The palace
fort, built originally by Akbar, contains also the work of his three
successors. The Sh&iacute;sh Mahal or Hall of Mirrors, which witnessed the
cession of the Panj&aacute;b to the Queen of England, was begun by Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n
and finished by Aurangzeb. The armoury contains a curious collection of
weapons. The B&aacute;dsh&aacute;h&iacute; Mosque opposite with its beautiful marble domes
and four lofty minarets of red sandstone was founded in 1673 in the
reign of Aurangzeb. The cupolas were so shaken by an earthquake in 1840
that they had to be removed. Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja Ranj&iacute;t Singh used the mosque as a
magazine. In the space between it and the Fort he laid out the pretty
orange garden known as the Huz&uacute;r&iacute; B&aacute;gh and set in it the marble
<i>b&aacute;radar&iacute;</i> which still adorns it. Close by are his own tomb and that of
Arjan D&aacute;s, the fifth Guru.</p>

<p><b>Buildings outside Lahore.</b>&mdash;The best example of Moghal architecture is
not at Lahore itself, but at Shahdara across the R&aacute;v&iacute;. Here in a fine
garden is the Mausoleum of Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r with its noble front and four
splendid towers. It enshrines an exquisite sarcophagus, which was
probably once in accordance with the Emperor's wish open to the sunlight
and the showers. Near by are the remains of the tombs of his beautiful
and imperious consort, Nur Jah&aacute;n, and of her brother Asaf Kh&aacute;n, father
of the lady of the T&aacute;j. Another building associated with Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r is
An&aacute;rkali's tomb beside the Civil Secretariat. The white marble
sarcophagus is a beautiful piece of work placed now in most
inappropriate surroundings. The tomb was reared by the Emperor to
commemorate the unhappy object of his youthful love. Half-a-mile off on
the Mult&aacute;n road is the Chauburj&iacute;, once the gateway of the Garden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> of
Zebunnissa a learned daughter of Aurangzeb. The garden has disappeared,
but the gateway, decorated with blue and green tiles, though partially
ruined, is still a beautiful object. On the other side of Lahore on the
road to Amritsar are the Shalim&aacute;r Gardens laid out by Sh&aacute;hjah&aacute;n for the
ladies of his court. When the paved channels are full and the fountains
are playing, and the lights of earthen lamps are reflected in the water,
Shalim&aacute;r is still a pleasant resort.</p>

<p>The Museum in An&aacute;rkal&iacute; contains much of interest to Indians and
Europeans. The "house of wonders" is very popular with the former. It
includes a very valuable collection of Buddhist sculptures. Opposite the
museum is the famous Zamzama gun (page <a href='#Page_187'><b>187</b></a>).</p>

<p><b>Growth of Lahore.</b> As the headquarters of an important Government and of
a great railway system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> Lahore has prospered. Owing to the influx of
workers the population has risen rapidly from 157,287 in 1881 to 228,687
in 1911. The railway alone affords support to 30,000 people, of whom
8000 are employed in the workshops.</p>

<p><b>Amritsar</b> (31.38 N., 74.53 E.) is a modern town founded in the last
quarter of the sixteenth century by the fourth Guru, R&aacute;m D&aacute;s, on a site
granted to him by Akbar. Here he dug the Amrita Saras or Pool of
Immortality, leaving a small platform in the middle as the site of that
Har Mandar, which rebuilt is to-day, under the name of the Darb&aacute;r S&aacute;hib,
the centre of Sikh devotion. The fifth Guru, Arjan D&aacute;s, completed the
Har Mandar. Early in the eighteenth century Amritsar became without any
rival the Mecca of the Sikhs, who had now assumed an attitude of warlike
resistance to their Muhammadan rulers. Once and again they were driven
out, but after the victory at Sirhind in 1763 they established
themselves securely in Amritsar, and rebuilt the temple which Ahmad Sh&aacute;h
had burned. Ranj&iacute;t Singh covered the Darb&aacute;r S&aacute;hib with a copper gilt
roof, whence Englishmen commonly call it the Golden Temple. He laid out
the R&aacute;m B&aacute;gh, still a beautiful garden, and constructed the strong fort
of Govindgarh outside the walls.</p>

<p><b>Trade and Manufactures.</b>&mdash;Amritsar lies in a hollow close to a branch of
the Upper B&aacute;r&iacute; Do&aacute;b Canal. Waterlogging is a great evil and accounts for
the terrible epidemics of fever, which have occurred from time to time.
The population has fluctuated violently, and at the last census was
152,756, or little larger than in 1881. Long before annexation the shawl
industry was famous. The caprice of fashion a good many years ago
decreed its ruin, but carpet weaving, for which Amritsar is still
famous, fortunately did something to fill the gap. Amritsar has also
been an entrep&ocirc;t of trade with other Asiatic countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> It has imported
raw silk from Bokh&aacute;ra, and later from China, and woven it into cloth. It
has dealt in China tea, but that is a decreasing trade, in opium from
Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, and in <i>charas</i> from Central Asia. There is a considerable
export of foreign piece goods to Kashm&iacute;r and the N. W. F. Province.</p>

<p><b>Mult&aacute;n</b> (30.1 N., 71.3 E.), though now the smallest of the four great
towns of the Panj&aacute;b, is probably the most ancient. It is very doubtful
whether it is the fortress of the Malloi, in storming which Alexander
was wounded. But when Hiuen Tsang visited it in 741 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> it was a
well-known place with a famous temple of the Sun God. Muhammad K&aacute;sim
conquered it in 712 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> (page <a href='#Page_166'><b>166</b></a>). It was not till the savage
Karmatian heretics seized Mult&aacute;n towards the end of the tenth century
that the temple, which stood in the fort, was destroyed. It was
afterwards rebuilt, but was finally demolished by order of Aurangzeb,
who set up in its place a mosque. Under the Moghals Mult&aacute;n was an
important town, through which the trade with Persia passed. Its later
history has already been noticed (pages 183 and 186).</p>

<p><b>The Fort</b> contains the celebrated Prahl&aacute;dpur&iacute; temple, much damaged during
the siege in 1848, but since rebuilt. Its proximity to the tomb of
Bah&aacute;wal Hakk, a very holy place in the eyes of the Muhammadans of the
S.W. Panj&aacute;b and Sindh, has at times been a cause of anxiety to the
authorities. Bah&aacute;wal Hakk and B&aacute;ba Far&iacute;d, the two great saints of the
S.W. Panj&aacute;b, were contemporaries and friends. They flourished in the
thirteenth century, and it probably would be true to ascribe largely to
their influence the conversion of the south-west Panj&aacute;b to Isl&aacute;m, which
was so complete and of which we know so little. The tomb of Bah&aacute;wal Hakk
was much injured during the siege, but afterwards repaired. Outside is a
small monument marking the resting place of the brave old Naw&aacute;b
Muzaffar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> Kh&aacute;n. Another conspicuous object is the tomb of Rukn ud d&iacute;n
'Alam, grandson of Bah&aacute;wal Hakk. An obelisk in the fort commemorates the
deaths of the two British officers who were murdered on the outbreak of
the revolt. A simpler epitaph would have befitted men who died in the
execution of their duty.</p>

<p><b>Trade and Manufactures.</b>&mdash;Though heat and dust make the climate of Mult&aacute;n
trying, it is a very healthy place. The population rose steadily from
68,674 in 1881 to 99,243 in 1911. The chief local industries are silk
and cotton weaving and the making of shoes. Mult&aacute;n has also some
reputation for carpets, glazed pottery and enamel, and of late for tin
boxes. A special feature of its commerce is the exchange of piece goods,
shoes, and sugar for the raw silk, fruits, spices, and drugs brought in
by Afgh&aacute;n traders. The Civil Lines lie to the south of the city and
connect it with the Cantonment, which is an important military station.</p>

<p><b>Pesh&aacute;war</b> (34.1 N., 71.35 E.) is 276 miles from Lahore and 190 from
K&aacute;bul. There is little doubt that the old name was Purushapura, the town
of Purusha, though Abu Rihan (Albiruni), a famous Arab geographer, who
lived in the early part of the eleventh century, calls it Parsh&aacute;war,
which Akbar corrupted into Pesh&aacute;war, or the frontier fort. As the
capital of King Kanishka it was in the second century of the Christian
era a great centre of Buddhism (page <a href='#Page_164'><b>164</b></a>). Its possession of Buddha's
alms bowl and of yet more precious relics of the Master deposited by
Kanishka in a great <i>stupa</i> (page <a href='#Page_203'><b>203</b></a>) made it the first place to be
visited by the Chinese pilgrims who came to India between 400 and 630
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Hiuen Tsang tells us the town covered 40 li or 6&frac34; miles. Its
position on the road to K&aacute;bul made it a place of importance under the
Moghal Empire. On its decline Pesh&aacute;war became part of the dominions of
the Dur&aacute;n&iacute; rulers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> K&aacute;bul, and finally fell into the hands of Ranj&iacute;t
Singh. His Italian general Avitabile ruled it with an iron rod. In 1901
it became the capital of the new N. W. F. Province.</p>

<p><b>The Town</b> lies near the B&aacute;ra stream in a canal-irrigated tract. On the
north-west it is commanded by the B&aacute;la Hiss&aacute;r, a fort outside the walls.
The suburbs with famous fruit gardens are on the south side, and the
military and civil stations to the west. The people to be seen in the
<i>baz&aacute;rs</i> of Pesh&aacute;war are more interesting than any of its buildings. The
Gor Khatr&iacute;, part of which is now the <i>tahs&iacute;l</i>, from which a bird's-eye
view of the town can be obtained, was successively the site of a
Buddhist monastery, a Hindu temple, a rest-house built by Jah&aacute;ng&iacute;r's
Queen, Nur Jah&aacute;n, and the residence of Avitabile. The most noteworthy
Muhammadan building is Muhabbat Kh&aacute;n's mosque. Avitabile used to hang
people from its minarets. The Hindu merchants live in the quarter known
as Andar Shahr, the scene of destructive fires in 1898 and 1913.
Pesh&aacute;war is now a well-drained town with a good water supply. It is an
entrep&ocirc;t of trade with K&aacute;bul and Bokh&aacute;ra. From the former come raw silk
and fruit, and from the latter gold and silver thread and lace <i>en
route</i> to Kashm&iacute;r. The K&aacute;bul&iacute; and Bokh&aacute;ran traders carry back silk
cloth, cotton piece goods, sugar, tea, salt, and Kashm&iacute;r shawls.</p>

<p><b>Simla</b> (31.6 N., 77.1 E.) lies on a spur of the Central Him&aacute;laya at a
mean height exceeding 7000 feet. A fine hill, Jakko, rising 1000 feet
higher, and clothed with <i>deod&aacute;r</i>, oak, and rhododendron, occupies the
east of the station and many of the houses are on its slopes. The other
heights are Prospect Hill and Observatory Hill in the western part of
the ridge. Viceregal Lodge is a conspicuous object on the latter, and
below, between it and the Annandale race-course, is a fine glen, where
the visitor in April from the dry and dusty plains can gather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> yellow
primroses (Primula floribunda) from the dripping rocks. The beautiful
Elysium Hill is on a small spur running northwards from the main ridge.
Simla is 58 miles by cart road from K&aacute;lka, at the foot of the hills, and
somewhat further by the narrow gauge railway.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p><b>History.</b>&mdash;Part of the site was retained at the close of the Gurkha war
in 1816, and the first English house, a wooden cottage with a thatched
roof, was built three years later. The first Governor General to spend
the summer in Simla was Lord Amherst in 1827. After the annexation of
the Panj&aacute;b in 1849 Lord Dalhousie went there every year, and from 1864
Simla may be said to have become the summer capital of India. It became
the summer headquarters of the Panj&aacute;b Government twelve years later. The
thirty houses of 1830 have now increased to about 2000. Six miles
distant on the beautiful Mah&aacute;su Ridge the Viceroy has a "Retreat," and
on the same ridge and below it at Mashobra there are a number of
European houses. There are excellent hotels in Simla, and the cold
weather tourist can pay it a very pleasant visit, provided he avoids the
months of January and February.</p>

<p><b>Sr&iacute;nagar</b> (34.5 N., 74.5 E.), the summer capital of the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja of
Kashm&iacute;r, is beautifully situated on both banks of the river Jhelam at a
level of 5250 feet above the sea. To the north are the Hariparvat or
Hill of Vishnu with a rampart built by Akbar and the beautiful Dal lake.
Every visitor must be rowed up its still waters to the N&aacute;s&iacute;m B&aacute;gh, a
grove of plane (<i>chen&acirc;r</i>) trees, laid out originally in the reign of the
same Emperor. Between the lake and the town is the Munsh&iacute; B&aacute;gh, in and
near which are the houses of Europeans including the Residency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> The
splendid plane trees beside the river bank, to which house boats are
moored, and the beautiful gardens attached to some of the houses, make
this a very charming quarter. The Takht i Sulim&aacute;n to the west of
Sr&iacute;nagar is crowned by a little temple, whose lower walls are of great
age. The town itself is intersected by evil-smelling canals and consists
in the main of a jumble of wooden houses with thatched roofs. Sanitary
abominations have been cleansed from time to time by great fires and
punished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> by severe outbreaks of cholera. The larger part of the
existing city is on the left side. The visitor may be content to view
the parts of the town to be seen as he is rowed down the broad waterway
from the Munsh&iacute; B&aacute;gh passing under picturesque wooden bridges, and
beside temples with shining metal roofs and the beautiful mosque of Sh&aacute;h
Hamad&aacute;n. On the left bank below the first bridge is the Shergarh&iacute; with
the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;ja's houses and the Government Offices. Opposite is a fine
<i>gh&aacute;t</i> or bathing place with stone steps. Between the third and fourth
bridges on the right bank is Sh&aacute;h Hamad&aacute;n's mosque, a carved cedar house
with Buddhist features, totally unlike the ordinary Indian mosque. The
stone mosque close by on the opposite side, built by Mir Jah&aacute;n, was
seemingly rejected by Muhammadans as founded by a woman, and is now a
State granary. The Jama Masjid is on the north side, but not on the
river bank. The tomb of the great king, Zain ul &Aacute;bid&iacute;n, is below the
fourth bridge, which bears his name. In the same quarter are the
storehouses of the dealers in carpets and art wares and the Mission
School. The last should be visited by anyone who wishes to see what a
manly education can make of material in some respects unpromising.</p>
